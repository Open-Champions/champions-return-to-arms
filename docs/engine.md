# Engine layer (0x160000–0x1a0000)

The Snowblind engine code that the game classes sit on: math, animation, the lump/resource
loader, controllers, model and text drawing, the world (terrain, water, pathfinding, camera),
particles, cutscenes, the task list and the frame loop helpers. 546 functions, 255 KB.

Everything here was read from the decompile and disassembly of `SLUS_209.73`; nothing was run.
Each claim is **Observed** unless it says *Inferred* or *Unknown*. Names are the ones in
`symbols/engine.tsv`, `names.tsv` and the other area files.

How far the reading went: the math library, animation core, resource lookup, pads, terrain
queries, pathfinder, cutscene runtime and task list were read function by function. Model
drawing, textures, text, world drawing, particles and the frame/GS code were only skimmed
(entry points identified from callers, strings and the first lines of each function). The
section "Not covered" lists what was not opened at all.

| 0x19ee10–0x19ffff | floor decals | `decal_add` |

The brief described 0x18c230–0x18e334 as "dialog state". It is the pause menu and the recall
potion. NPC conversations (`dialog_start`, `dialog_isOpen`) are in the audio-save range at
0x22ee2c–0x2305ff. The only dialog code in this range is cutscene dialog (below).

## Conventions

- Angles are signed 16-bit, 65536 to a full turn. `math_cos16` (0x166630) and `math_sin16`
  (0x1666e0) take them; `math_atan2_16` (0x166798) returns one. The script built-ins
  `cos1000` and `sin1000` call the first two, which is how they are told apart.
- `mat3` is 9 floats, `mat34` is a `mat3` followed by a translation (12 floats), `mat4` is 16.
  A vector is transformed as `v.x*m[0..2] + v.y*m[3..5] + v.z*m[6..8] (+ m[9..11])`
  (`mat34_transformPoint`, 0x1660a0).
- Time inside animation is in ticks (1/60 s). Cutscene key times are seconds.
- World units: terrain samples are 4 units apart, path cells 24, terrain grid cells 160,
  object grid cells 256.

## Math (0x162310–0x166fff)

Small leaf functions; the symbol file lists all of them with argument order. The ones game
code calls most:

| Address | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 0x166630 / 0x1666e0 | `math_cos16` / `math_sin16` | polynomial on the half angle; 245 and 282 callers |
| 0x166798 | `math_atan2_16` | `atan2f` × 65536/2π |
| 0x166c18 | `angle_approach` | turn `current` toward `target` by `rate × |difference|`, clamped to [min, max] |
| 0x166bc8 | `angle_turnDir` | which way to turn, optional absolute difference |
| 0x163b30 | `mat34_setPosRotZ` | world matrix from position and facing |
| 0x163000 | `mat34_rotateAxis` | rotate in place about X, Y or Z |
| 0x162808 / 0x162698 | `mat34_mul` / `mat4_mulMat34` | matrix products |
| 0x1660a0 / 0x166158 | `mat34_transformPoint` / `mat34_rotateVec` | apply a matrix |
| 0x1658f0 | `math_hermite` | cubic Hermite; with tangents 0 it is the smoothstep the camera and blend code use |
| 0x166480, 0x166550, 0x1668b8, 0x164330 | `quat_mul`, `quat_normalize`, `mat3_fromQuat`, `quat_fromMat3` | quaternions are x, y, z, w |
| 0x166b48 | `math_noise` | smooth noise from a 256-entry table; **the table is different on every machine** (see Per-machine state) |

The block 0x167008–0x1685ef is a small rigid-body integrator used by the physics props in the
objects area (`PhProp_initPhysics` 0x155110, `PushPhysicsProp`). Body layout as far as read:
+0x00 inverse mass, +0x04 inverse inertia (3 floats), +0x10 position, +0x1c orientation
quaternion, +0x2c linear momentum (`rigidbody_pointVelocity` multiplies it by the inverse
mass), +0x38 angular momentum (*Inferred* by symmetry), +0x44 rotation matrix, +0x8c angular
velocity.

## Animation (0x16caa8–0x1711c7)

### State structure

Every animated thing embeds an animation state. In a creature it is at object+0x114
(so the track count is the byte at +0x118 and the first track's time is at +0x134).

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | ptr | pose buffer currently holding this state's blended pose, or 0 | cleared at the top of `anim_advance`; set by `anim_buildPose` |
| +0x04 | s8 | number of active tracks | every push/start function |
| +0x05 | s8 | capacity (tracks) | compared before pushing |
| +0x06 | u16 | union of the flags of all tracks alive at the last advance, plus status bits 0x80 and 0x400 | written at the end of `anim_advance` (0x16d748); start functions OR the new flags in |
| +0x08 | track[] | 0x20 bytes per track, index 0 is the bottom layer | |

Track (0x20 bytes):

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | ptr | `.anm` data |
| +0x04 | ptr | decoder slot (lazy, from `animcache_alloc`), or 0 |
| +0x08 | float | weight |
| +0x0c | float | weight change per tick (blend-in rate) |
| +0x10 | float | second weight ("life"); the effective weight is min(weight, life) |
| +0x14 | float | life change per tick (0 or negative) |
| +0x18 | float | time in ticks |
| +0x1c | u16 | flags |
| +0x1e | s16 | index of the next sound event |

Track flags (all read in `anim_advance` or `anim_buildPose`):

| Bit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0x0001 | loop |
| 0x0002 | when this track is fully blended in, delete every track below it except those with 0x1000 |
| 0x0004 | report the end: sets status 0x80 in state+6, and 0x400 as well if it is the top track |
| 0x0020 | used by the cutscene to mark the speaker's talk track (`anim_findTrackByFlag(…, 0x20)`); the engine itself does not test it |
| 0x0040 | ignore the speed argument (advance exactly one tick, weights too) |
| 0x0100 | ease the weight with smoothstep when blending the pose |
| 0x0200 | keep the track after its life reached 0 |
| 0x0800 | root motion: joint 0's x/y translation is removed from the pose and returned as a delta |
| 0x1000 | persistent: survives the 0x0002 purge and `anim_dropNonPersistent` |
| 0x2000 | paused: time does not advance |
| 0x4000 | root yaw: joint 0's rotation about Z is removed from the pose and returned as an angle delta |

### `.anm` header

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | int | joint count | loop bound in `animtrack_decode` |
| +0x04 | int | length in ticks | compared with track time everywhere |
| +0x08 | ptr | bit-packed key stream (16-bit words) | `animtrack_decode` (0x16e468) |
| +0x0c, +0x10 | ptr | relocated by `anm_relocate`; use *Unknown* | 0x1707b8 |
| +0x14 … +0x33 | 4 × {float seconds; u8 mask; pad} | the four **event slots** | first loop of `anim_advance` |
| +0x34 | ptr | sound name table: {name, sample} pairs ending with 0 | `anm_bindSounds` (0x16cc38) |
| +0x38 | ptr | sound events, 0x1c bytes each, ended by time 0x7fffffff: +0 time in ticks, +4 s16 sound index (negative = special id), +8 group selector, +0xa…+0xe volume/pitch/delay jitter amounts | `animsound_fireRange`, `animsound_play`; the jitter field meanings are *Inferred* |
| +0x3c | u8 | sound throttle group | `anim_advance` 0x16d9d8 |
| +0x3d | u8 | data version; `anm_bindSounds` zeroes the jitter fields when 0 | |
| +0x48 | u64 | joint mask: a set bit means the joint is not driven by this file. Non-zero marks a partial-body animation, which does not use up blend weight | `anim_buildPose` |

The key stream is delta coded with per-joint bit widths; a decoder slot (LRU pool, head at
`g_animCacheLruHead` 0x791e90) holds, per joint (0x3c bytes from slot+0x1c): the key tick for
position and rotation (two s16), position, position velocity, quaternion, quaternion velocity.
Slot+0x18 is the last root yaw, slot+0x14 points back at the owning track.
`animcache_alloc` (0x16e388) never steals a slot whose owner has flag 0x0800 or 0x4000, because
for those tracks the slot holds the root-motion base and is simulation state, not a cache.

### Starting, stopping, blending

| Function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `anim_push` (0x170838) | append at weight 1, no blending; ignored when the state is full |
| `anim_start` (0x16cfe0) | append with weight 0 rising by 1/(blendIn×60) per tick (the first track of an empty state reaches full weight on the next tick). When the state is full the top track is replaced |
| `anim_startBlendInOut` (0x16ceb0) | as `anim_start`, and life = length × r falling by r = 1/(blendOut×60) per tick, so the track fades out over the last `blendOut` seconds and is gone exactly at its end |
| `anim_pushChained` (0x170938) | append at weight 1 with start time = previous track's time − previous length + 2 (negative: it waits) |
| `anim_pushWithWeights` (0x1708c0) | append with explicit weight, rate, life, life rate |
| `anim_stop` (0x16d1a0) | remove the tracks playing a given file: at once, or by giving them a negative weight rate |
| `anim_clear` (0x1707b0), `anim_dropNonPersistent` (0x16cb50) | drop all / all non-persistent tracks |
| `anim_jumpTopToEnd` (0x170bc8), `anim_snapTopToEnd` (0x170c80) | put the top track on its last frame |
| `anim_syncToSimFrame` (0x1709f8) | time = `g_simFrame` mod length for every track |
| `anim_randomizeTopTime` (0x16d0b8) | time = random fraction of the length, **from the cosmetic generator** |

A track at time < 0 is skipped by the advance (it only counts up), which is how chained and
delayed tracks wait.

### `anim_advance` (0x16d748)

`eventBits = anim_advance(speed, state, soundPos, rootDelta, yawDelta)`; called once per tick
per creature by `Creature_stepAnim` (0x1162b0) and `Player_animStep` (0x1b9520), and once per
drawn frame for world scenery by `world_draw` (0x189910).

Per call, from the top track down:

1. **Events.** For each of the four header slots, if `time/60 ≤ slot.seconds < (time+step)/60`
   the slot's mask byte is OR-ed into the return value. Events of every track are merged, also
   those of tracks that are fading out. The engine attaches no meaning to the bits; the
   animation file and the caller's state handler define them (*Unknown* per class — reading
   the creature handlers that receive the value would settle it).
2. **Time.** Unless paused, time += `speed × 0.99999994` (or one tick with flag 0x40).
3. **Sounds** (only when `soundPos` is non-zero and only for the top track): sound events whose
   time was passed are played through `animsound_fireRange`. A per-group limiter keyed on the
   low byte of `g_drawFrame` skips them when too many started in the same rendered frame.
   Special ids below −1 go to `g_animSoundCallback` (set to `game_animEventFoley`, which only
   plays sounds).
4. **End of file.** Looping tracks wrap (root motion and root yaw are carried across the
   wrap). Non-looping tracks get life 0; with flag 0x0004 the status bits are raised.
5. **Weights.** weight += rate, life += life rate (both × speed unless 0x40). A track whose
   life is ≤ 0 is removed unless it has 0x0200. A track with 0x0002 whose min(weight, life)
   reached 1 removes the tracks under it.
6. **Root motion.** For each track with 0x0800 the decoder gives joint 0's x/y at the new
   time; the change since the last call, times the track's effective weight, is added to
   `rootDelta[0..1]`. For 0x4000 the change of joint 0's yaw is added to `*yawDelta`.

Effective weight of a track = clamp(min(weight, life, what the tracks above left over), 0, 1).

### Root motion in a creature

`Creature_stepAnim` passes creature+0xbc (two floats) and creature+0xc4 (s16) as the outputs.
After the call it multiplies the delta by the creature's scale (+0xdc), rotates it by
`facing − 0x4000` into world x/y, and multiplies delta and yaw by `(60 − slow)/60` when the
slow amount at +0x2fc is 1…60 (the same factor already scaled `speed`). The code that adds
+0xbc/+0xc0 to the position is in the creatures area. So position depends on: track times,
weights, the facing angle, scale and the slow amount.

### Pose

`anim_buildPose` (0x16ed40) walks down from the top track to the first fully weighted track
at which every joint is covered (joint masks AND-ed to zero), decodes it, then blends every
track above it by its effective weight (quaternion blend per joint, joint
mask respected). The result is 0x18 bytes per joint (3×3 rotation as s16/4096, translation as
s16/64) in a pose buffer taken from a second LRU pool (0x7b8340/0x7b8344). Draw callers may get
no buffer and then draw a default pose; simulation callers (`anim_getJointMatrix` 0x16f720,
used by `model_getAttachPoint` and `model_getSamplePoint`) always get one (a shared scratch
buffer at 0x7b89c0 as last resort). The values do not depend on which buffer was used.

## Lumps and resources (0x1711e8–0x173e9f)

`g_lumps` (0x7b9480, count `g_lumpCount` 0x41bf7c), 0x28 bytes per loaded lump:

| Offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| +0x00 | name, 16 chars |
| +0x10 | pointer to the data |
| +0x14 | flags; bit 0 = this record is a single entry loaded on its own: the data starts with the entry name and the payload is at +0x100 |
| +0x18 | size kept after fix-up |
| +0x1c | sound memory the lump took |
| +0x20 | keep level |
| +0x24 | 1 when the loader owns the memory |

A lump in memory starts with a 16-bit entry count, then 12-byte records
{name pointer, data pointer, size} sorted by name (`lump_findEntry` does a binary search).

- `res_find(lump, entry)` (0x17365c, 429 callers) is the one lookup everything uses. It loads
  the lump with `lump_load` (blocking CD read) when it is not in memory.
- `resref_init` / `resref_get` (0x173768 / 0x17377c) cache a pointer and refresh it when
  `g_lumpGeneration` changes.
- `lump_fixup` (0x1717d0) walks a fresh lump and calls `lump_fixupEntry` (0x17153c), which
  dispatches on the file extension: `.anm` → `anm_relocate` + `anm_bindSounds`, `.vif` →
  `model_relocate`, `.tex` → `tex_relocate`, `.world` → `world_fixup`, `.uni`/`.txt` →
  `text_registerTable`, plus `.fnt`, `.vag`. Region prefixes (`ntsc_`, `pal_…`) are handled
  there.
- Lifetime: `lump_raiseKeepLevel(n)` marks everything loaded so far; `lump_unloadUpToLevel(n)`
  frees lumps from the end of the table whose level is ≤ n.
- CD access: `cd_findFile`, `cd_readAsync` (one read at a time, completion flagged from
  `lump_pollAsync`), `cd_readBlocking`, `cd_isBusy`, `cd_waitIdle`.
- `text_lookup(key)` (0x173c84, 267 callers) returns the wide string stored after the key in
  the string files; 8192-slot open-addressing hash (`text_hash`). A missing key yields the text
  "NF:" + key.

## Controllers (0x173ea8–0x174e77)

`pad_readPort` produces an 8-byte raw record: u16 buttons, four stick bytes, two analog
bytes. `pad_apply` (0x174410) turns a record into a pad structure (`g_pads`, 0x58 bytes each):

| Offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| +0x08 | buttons held (plus four synthetic stick-direction bits 0x100000–0x800000) |
| +0x0c | buttons pressed this tick |
| +0x10 | pressed, with auto-repeat after 20 ticks |
| +0x14, +0x18 | left stick x, y |
| +0x1c, +0x20 | right stick |
| +0x28 … +0x54 | per-button pressures (0 or 1 from the bits; +0x38 and +0x50 from the two analog bytes) |

`pad_buttonValue` (0x174d80) returns the pressure offline and a plain 0/1 from the held bits
in a net game. `pad_rumble` is called from simulation code but only stores local motor state;
`pad_updateRumble` (called by `tasks_run`) drives the motors of local slots.

Note for finding G5: `pad_updateRumble` does store to 0x41c138 (it decrements it and clamps
at 0; reference at 0x174760) and `pad_apply` decrements 0x41bfc0 while it is non-zero. Neither
store can make the value non-zero and no other reference exists, so the finding stands, but
"never written" should read "never set".

## Models, sprites, text (skimmed)

- `model_draw` (0x1779b0): one call per model per frame. Draw parameters are globals at
  0x41c149–0x41c170 that callers set before and `model_resetDrawState` clears after.
- Model queries usable from simulation code: `model_getAttachPoint` (attach records of 0x34
  bytes: joint index, local matrix), `model_getSamplePoint` / `model_getSamplePointCount`
  (surface points as s16/16 with a joint index), `model_buildHideMask`, `model_getBounds`.
- Every drawer first checks that `g_dlCapacity − used` leaves 3000 units and silently draws
  nothing otherwise (this is the "render buffer" test of finding D13).
- Text: `text_begin(font, …)`, any number of `text_draw*`, `text_end()`. Strings are 16-bit.
  `wstr_format` is the engine's sprintf (%d, %s, %.2f).

## World, terrain and water

`g_world` (0x44fdc8) points at the fixed-up `.world` structure:

| Offset | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| +0x04 | root of the chunk tree | `world_collectChunksInBox` |
| +0x08, +0x0c | terrain grid origin (cells of 160 units) | `terrain_collectElements` |
| +0x10, +0x14 | terrain grid width, height | |
| +0x18 | grid of pointers to s16 element-index lists ended by −1 | |
| +0x20 | terrain elements, 0x24 bytes each | |
| +0x24 | chunks, 0x3c bytes each (+0x08…+0x1c bounds, +0x24 flags: 0x80 water) | |
| +0x28, +0x2c, +0x30, +0x34 | path grid origin x, y, width, height (cells of 24 units) | `path_search` |
| +0x38 | path cells, one u32 each | |
| +0x50, +0x54 | moving pieces: count, array of 0x1c bytes (+0 chunk index, +0x14/+0x16 rotation, +0x18 terrain element index) | `world_movePiece` |

Terrain element (0x24 bytes): +0 s16 bounds (minX, minY, maxX, maxY), +8 visit stamp, +0xc
pointer to a height field, +0x10 flags (1 mirrored, 2 ignored, 4 tested by ray casts),
+0x14/+0x18/+0x1c position (ints), +0x20/+0x22 rotation cos/sin (s16/32767).
Height field: +0 origin x, +4 origin y, +8 width, +0xc height (in samples), +0x12 s16 maximum
height, +0x14 u16 samples: height = sample >> 4 (signed), low 4 bits are flags.

| Function | Use |
|---|---|
| `terrain_height(radius, world, pos)` 0x183820 | highest ground under a disc; −1000000 when there is none. 49 callers |
| `terrain_heightBelow` 0x1834a8 | same but ignores anything more than 12 above pos.z (walking under bridges) |
| `terrain_heightAtPoint` 0x182f28 | single sample |
| `terrain_testFlag1` 0x183b48 | is any sample under the disc flagged with bit 0 |
| `terrain_raycast` 0x18a5c0 | first terrain hit along a ray, marching 240 units at a time |
| `world_raycast` 0x18ad94 | terrain plus object circles (objects from `world_collectObjectsInBox`) |
| `terrain_sweepCircle` 0x185a40 | moving circle against the samples (physics props, projectiles) |
| `world_setPieceCollision`, `world_movePiece`, `world_setPieceHeight` | doors, lifts and bridges: change the terrain element of a moving piece |
| `water_test` 0x189438 | is the position inside a water chunk; optional water height |
| `water_disturb` 0x189514 | add a ripple to the 32×32 grids of the water chunks around a position; returns how many chunks were found |

## Pathfinding (0x183e40–0x185447)

- Requests go into `g_pathQueue` (128 entries of 0x30 bytes: world, start, goal, radius, output
  buffer, capacity, requester handle, type). `Creature_requestPath` (0x1164c0) is the only
  caller of the four `path_request*` functions; its output buffer is creature+0x23c, 16 points.
  When the queue is full the requester is told "no path" immediately.
- `path_service(blocking)` (0x184798) takes the oldest request, clears the marks of the
  previous search, and runs `path_search`: a breadth-first wave over the 8-connected cell grid
  with four ring buffers of 512 cells, stopping when a cell passes the request's goal test or
  after 80 rounds. Cell word: low 8 bits = which neighbours can be entered, bits 8–15 = search
  mark (direction it was reached from), upper 16 bits non-zero = blocked.
- Goal tests by type: 0 within the radius of the goal point; 1 within the radius and
  `world_raycast` to the goal is clear; 2 within the radius, at least 120 away when the radius
  is larger than that, and `terrain_raycast` clear (ranged attackers); 3 not read.
- The result is written as (x, y) integer pairs ending with (−1, −1), and delivered by calling
  the requester's virtual slot 7 with 1 or 0.
- `g_pathEnabled` (0x44f090): while 0, `path_search` returns "no path" at once. It is cleared
  when a net game is set up (0x13dce0) and set by `world_resetRuntime` at level start.
- Timer: `path_service` returns when not blocking and hardware timer T0 > 8999;
  `path_search` suspends when not blocking and T0 > 7512. All search state is in globals, so
  a suspended search continues exactly where it stopped. In a net game `net_frameLoop` and
  `cut_advance` call `path_service(1)`, so every request queued in a tick is answered in that
  tick on every machine (finding D5).

## Camera

`camera_setView(pos, mat34)` (0x18a2b0) writes `g_cameraPos` (0x44f038) and `g_cameraMatrix`
(0x44f110); other writers were not searched for exhaustively. Its callers are `cut_runFrame`, the inventory
and stats screens, and the game camera (`Camera_apply` 0x2035c8). `camera_setProjection`
builds the projection and frustum planes; `camera_setFarClip` caps at 1800.
`camera_updateFocus` (0x18a520) derives `g_cameraFocus` = position + forward × 600 and is
called by `cut_runFrame` and by `drawWorld`.

## Cutscenes (0x196344–0x19b673)

### Runtime state

| Global | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `g_cutActors` 0x83d184, `g_cutActorCount` 0x83d188 | actor table from the file |
| `g_cutKeys` 0x83d190, `g_cutKeyCount` 0x83d194, `g_cutKeyIndex` 0x44fcfc | key list and the next key to run |
| `g_cutFrame` 0x44fce0 | clock in ticks; key time = frame / 60 |
| `g_cutFlags` 0x83d19c | header flags |
| `g_cutDialogLines` 0x44fd1c, `g_cutDialogLineCount` 0x44fd20, `g_cutDialogLine` 0x44fd0c | dialog lines and the next line |
| `g_cutLipsyncReady` 0x83d180, buffers 0x83d170 / 0x83d178 with state words 0x83d174 / 0x83d17c | lip-sync animation preload |
| `g_cutVoiceDoneCount` 0x44fd28, `g_cutVoiceDoneSent` 0x44fd2c, `g_cutVoiceDoneMsg` 0x83d1c8 | "voice finished" hand-shake |
| `g_cutCamPos` 0x83d110, yaw 0x44fcd4, pitch 0x44fcd6, roll 0x44fcd8, fov 0x44fcdc | camera track output |
| `g_cutSpeaker` 0x83d18c | creature speaking the current line |

Actor record (0x2c bytes): +0x00 object pointer (filled at setup), +0x04 a value copied from
or passed to the object, +0x08 name, +0x1c position (3 floats), +0x28 s16 facing, +0x2a byte
copied to creature+0x230, +0x2b non-zero = create the object for the cutscene, zero = bind an
existing level object found by name within 240 units of the position.

Header flags: 1 = already set up (positions were converted with `cut_anchorToWorld` relative
to the level object named like the cutscene); 2 and 4 each extend the key list by three keys
and are treated differently when `g_networkMode` is set (tests at 0x19aa18 and 0x19aae0; details *Unknown*); 8 selects
a different way of hiding and restoring the rest of the level's objects; 0x10 is set by the
code for ordinary cutscenes and controls the letterbox. Header word +0x70 × 0.1 is passed to
`light_setScale`.

### Per tick

`cut_start` (from script `cutScene`) resets the state and adds `cut_runTask` (run, priority
300) and `cut_drawFrame` (draw, 300). `cut_runFrame` then does, each tick:

1. lip-sync preload (see Dialog);
2. on the first tick `cut_setup`: bind/create actors, load dialog, hide other objects. A
   bound object is moved to the actor's start position unless it has an `autoprop` or
   `autodoor` property. Actors
   named `Player` and `Player2` are stand-in `Player` objects created with `Player_ctor` when
   that player is alive; other created actors go through `world_createObject`. All actors get
   object flags 0x88000;
3. `cut_advance(clock)`: sets `g_cosmeticSeed = g_cutFrame + i` and runs actor *i*'s `run`
   (slot 4) for every actor, calls `path_service(1)`, increments `g_cutFrame`, then executes
   every key whose time has come with `cut_execKey`;
4. `cut_evalCamera(clock)`, `camera_setProjection`, `camera_setView`, `camera_updateFocus`;
5. skip test: any player's pressed bit 0x800 in `g_pads` sets `g_cutSkip` (in a net game on
   levels `endgood` / `endbad` only after 300 ticks). Skipping stops the streams and runs
   `cut_advance` in a loop until the key list is exhausted;
6. when the key list is exhausted: `cut_end`, which moves the real players to where the
   `Player` stand-in ended (other players are spread around it with `world_findFreeSpot` and
   `terrain_height`), deletes created actors and restores bound ones.

### Key types

Keys are 20 bytes: `float time; s16 actor; s16 type; s32 a, b, c`.

Camera keys (actor −100). All but type 6 are evaluated every tick by `cut_evalCamera`
(0x19712c), which looks up the keys before and after the clock with `cut_findKeyBefore` /
`cut_findKeyFrom` and interpolates with Hermite splines whose tangents come from the
neighbouring keys:

| Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | camera position (a, b, c) | writes `g_cutCamPos` |
| 1 | yaw, a = 16-bit angle (default −0x2000) | writes 0x44fcd4 |
| 2 | pitch, a = 16-bit angle (default 10000) | writes 0x44fcd6 |
| 3 | look-at: a = actor index or −1. Yaw and pitch are aimed at the actor (its position plus half its height) and blended from the previous type-3 key's aim to the next with smoothstep over the interval | 0x198958–0x198d08 |
| 4 | tangent break: splines stop (zero tangent) at this time | compared against key times in every spline section |
| 5 | cut: the camera jumps at this time. Raises `mainloop_startFadeWait(4)` just after it, and when the next key is a cut it asks the world to preload the next view (0x189df0) | calls at 0x198e98 and 0x198f10 |
| 6 | far clip = a × 12 | `cut_execKey` → `camera_setFarClip` |
| 7 | fade through black centred on the key (colour offset from the distance in time, ±0.64 s) | `gfx_setColorOffset` call 0x198db8 |
| 8 | roll in degrees (a × 182) | writes 0x44fcd8 |
| 9 | field of view in degrees (default 50) | writes 0x44fcdc |
| 10 | screen darken ramp around the key | `gfx_setScreenDarken` call 0x198e84 |

Dialog keys (actor −99):

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | next dialog line (below) |
| 1 | sets 0x44fd04, which hides the subtitle |
| 3 | wait until the voice line has ended on every machine (handled in `cut_advance`) |
| 7 | start the next queued entry of the level's stream directory on stream 2 (`stream_clearHold(2)`, queue the one after with `music_playLevelIndex`) |

Object keys (actor ≥ 0, `cut_execKey` 0x196788):

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | walk to (a, b, c): creature virtual slot 27 with argument 1, target stored at +0x104…+0x10c |
| 1 | follow / face actor a: handle at creature+0x234, slot 27 with argument 3 |
| 2 | play animation. a = index among the object's animations, or a name hash when c = 0xbadfeed. b = mode: 0, 1, 6 one-shot with end report; 2 loop; 3 short blend in and out; 4, 5 loop that replaces lower tracks |
| 3 / 4 | virtual slot 3 with argument 1 / 0 |
| 5, 6, 7 | take the object off the world grid (`obj_moveOffGrid`); creatures get bit 8 of +0x231 |
| 8 | put it back (`obj_updateGridCell`) |
| 9 | `obj_addToAlwaysDraw` |
| 10 | teleport to (a, b, c) and put back; a creature other than the speaker is reset with slot 27 argument 0 |
| 11 | facing = a |
| 12 | toggle bit 0x200000 of the creature's 64-bit flags at +0xa8 |

Case 10 runs on into 11 and 12 in the decompile; whether that is real fall-through or a
decompiler artefact was not checked in the disassembly (*Unknown*).

### Dialog lines and voice

- `cut_loadDialog` (0x1964d4) finds `<cutscene>.dbin` in `<level>.lmp`. A line is 0x448
  bytes: +0x21 string-table key of the subtitle, +0x31 voice entry name, +0x41 name of the
  speaking object.
- Voice audio is stream 1. At setup the first line is queued held
  (`stream_playLevel(1, "<voice>.vag", 0x28)`). A type-0 key releases the hold
  (`stream_clearHold(1)`), reads the entry length (`stream_levelEntryLength`), and queues the
  following line held. So each line starts on its key and the next one is already buffered.
- Speaker: the line's speaker name is resolved with `world_findObjectByName`; it must be a
  creature. Its u16 at +0x3c4 is set to 44000 (the previous speaker's back to 1150; meaning
  *Unknown*).
- Speaker animation, two paths (0x196a9c):
  - lip-sync: if the per-line animation `<voice>.anm` has finished loading, it is started with
    `anim_start(0.3, …, flags 0x26)` and the creature's `idle` animation is chained after it;
  - otherwise the generic `talk` animation loops, and `idle` is started with a negative time
    computed from the voice entry length, so that it takes over when the line should be done.
- Lip-sync preload (`cut_runFrame` 0x199958–0x199b60): while line *n* plays, the animation for
  line *n+1* (an entry `<voice>.anm` of the level stream file) is read with `cd_readAsync`
  into one of two buffers; when the read completes, `g_cutLipsyncReady` is incremented on the
  next tick. The read is only started when `cd_isBusy()` is false.
- While the speaker has a track with flag 0x20, `cut_advance` compares that track's time with
  `audio_streamPosition(1)` and nudges every track time of the speaker by ±0.1 per tick
  (finding D8).
- Wait key (type 3): each machine sends game message `g_cutVoiceDoneMsg` once its own
  `audio_streamStatus(1)` reports the stream ended; the handler at 0x198f64 counts them, and
  the key list does not advance until the count reaches max(1, `net_countActivePeers()`).
  While waiting, `g_cutFrame` is held.
- Subtitles are drawn by `cut_drawFrame` from the line before `g_cutDialogLine`.

## Pause menu and recall (0x18c230–0x18e627)

`pauseMenu_open(pad)` adds `pauseMenu_task` as a **draw** task; it reads `g_rawPads` and, in a
net game, sends its choices as game messages (0x1d9250). `g_paused` is only touched offline.
`pauseMenu_isOpen` is read by `net_frameLoop` and `net_predictLocalPlayer` to decide about
the prediction copy. `recall_execute(slot)` is reached from `hud_onMsg`; it consumes a
`recallpotion` item and creates a gate object at each living player.

## Particles, glows, trails, beams (skimmed)

- Particle definitions are static objects built by `particleDef_ctor` / `particleDef_init`.
  `particle_spawn(…, def, pos, vel)` (175 callers) takes a particle from a fixed pool and does
  nothing when the pool is empty.
- `particle_updateTask` is registered with task flags 2 and runs in the **run** phase, once per
  simulated tick; `particle_drawTask` runs in the draw phase.
- Particle groups (`particleGroup_create` … `_free`) are 16 slots with their own lists and
  matrix; a group that stays empty for 30 ticks is freed by the update task.
- `glow_add` queues up to 1024 camera-facing sprites per frame; `trail_*` (64 trails) and
  `beam_*` (20 beams) are handle based, handle = generation << 8 | slot.
- Random numbers in all of this come from `g_cosmeticSeed` only (see below).

## Tasks and frame

`g_tasks` (0x840100): 16-byte records {function, priority, name, flags}, kept sorted by
priority by `task_add`; `g_taskCount` 0x44fdb8. Flags: 0 = run phase, 1 = draw phase, 2 = run
phase (used only for `updateParticles` and one other task). `tasks_call(exclude, include)`
(0x19e798) calls every task whose flags have none of `exclude` and, unless `include` is −1,
at least one of `include`: `tasks_run` uses (1, −1), the draw phase in
`mainloop_runSession` uses (0, 1). A task may add or remove tasks while the list is being
walked (`g_taskCursor` is adjusted).

`gfx_beginFrame` / `gfx_endFrame` bracket a rendered frame; the second increments
`g_drawFrame` (0x44fdd0). `g_simFrame` (0x44fdcc) counts ticks: `tasks_run` increments it
offline, `net_frameLoop` sets it to `g_netFrame` around each tick. `engine_frameStep` returns
1 or 2 depending on how many vertical blanks the last frame took.

`engine_init` (0x19d19c) is the boot sequence: stack check, IOP modules, GS, `engine.lmp`,
fonts, then the `*_init` functions of this range.

## Per-machine state

Places in this range where something that differs between machines can reach, or is next to,
shared game state. "Shared" means it can affect what the lockstep simulation computes.

| # | What | Kind | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | `g_cosmeticSeed` is seeded from the CPU cycle counter (COP0 Count) at boot. Anything derived from it differs per machine from the first frame | Observed | `engine_init` 0x19d1e0 (mfc0), store 0x19d1f8 |
| P2 | `g_noiseTable` is built from that seed, so `math_noise` returns different values on every machine. Its simulation-side callers are `Torch` run 0x2b2088, `Lantern` run 0x2b3554 and `Lamp` run 0x2b3858, which also index it with their own object pointer; they write only light radius and light position fields (+0x68…+0x84) | Observed for the table and callers; that those fields are render-only is Inferred | `math_buildNoiseTable` 0x1646c8; `math_noise` 0x166b48 |
| P3 | `anim_randomizeTopTime` sets a track's time from `g_cosmeticSeed`. The `Critter` constructor (0x2547fc; spawned by `VampireLord` run and by creature code 0x1125e0) calls it right after `anim_push(…, 0x801)`: a **looping root-motion** track. Its root-motion deltas, and so its position, start from a different phase on each machine | Observed for the calls and flags; the effect on position is Inferred | 0x254e2c–0x254e34; seed use 0x16d0d8 |
| P4 | The same call follows a plain looping `anim_push(…, 1)` in the constructors of FireBeetle (0x24587c, 0x24726c), Ghoul 0x266088, AutoProp 0x23c44c, SmallSpider 0x2ab450, SpiderQueen 0x2ad1c0, BlackWidow 0x2ab958, NPC 0x29dcc4 / 0x29df04 / 0x29e2a4, VampireLord 0x2b76e4, Vampire 0x2b69d0, UserParamProp 0x15711c and PoisonProjectile 0x2b153c. Idle phase, and therefore the tick on which that animation's event bits fire, differs per machine. Harmless only if those animations carry no events the class acts on | Observed for the calls; consequence Unknown — check each class's idle animation for event slots | call sites in the symbol note of `anim_randomizeTopTime` |
| P5 | `rigidbody_init` draws the initial orientation of a physics body from `g_cosmeticSeed`. Callers: `PhProp_initPhysics` 0x155110 (reached from `loot_generateDrops`), `PushPhysicsProp` slot 8 0x15dbd4, 0x15dddc. If where a prop or dropped item comes to rest depends on its orientation, its position differs per machine | Observed for the draw; effect Inferred | 0x168350 |
| P6 | Cutscene lip-sync choice: whether the speaker gets the per-line lip-sync animation or the generic talk loop depends on whether a local asynchronous disc read has completed (`g_cutLipsyncReady`, slot state) by the time the dialog key runs, and the read cannot start while the local CD is busy. Different animation → different tracks, flags and end-status bits on the speaker | Observed for the dependency; that the read can actually be late is Inferred | read start 0x199a24, busy test 0x199a64, choice 0x196a9c |
| P7 | Speaker track times are nudged toward the local audio stream position (finding D8) | Observed | `cut_advance` 0x199444–0x1995c8, `audio_streamPosition` call 0x199468 |
| P8 | Wait key: the local stream status decides when this machine sends its "done" message; the cutscene clock resumes when the count is complete. Correct only if the message handler runs on the same tick everywhere | Observed here; delivery timing belongs to netcode (Unknown) | status 0x199398, handler 0x198f64 |
| P9 | `cut_advance` and `cut_runFrame` overwrite `g_cosmeticSeed` with shared values (`g_cutFrame + i` before each actor's run, `g_simFrame` at the end of the tick, `i + 0x392fa` before creating actor *i*). This makes cosmetic draws inside actor `run` calls repeatable during cutscenes, but only there | Observed | 0x1992a8, 0x199f88, 0x19af20 |
| P10 | `anim_advance` reads `g_drawFrame` to limit sounds, and skips sound bookkeeping when the caller passes no position (the real local player while its prediction copy exists). Only the sound cursor (track+0x1e) and sounds are affected; event bits, weights and root motion are not | Observed | 0x16d9d8; `Player_animStep` passes 0 for flag 0x200000 |
| P11 | `anim_buildPose` reads `g_drawFrame` to choose a pose buffer. Values do not depend on the buffer | Observed | 0x16ed9c |
| P12 | World scenery animations are advanced from draw code, once per rendered frame | Observed; nothing in this range reads them from simulation code (Inferred cosmetic) | `world_draw` 0x189910 |
| P13 | Pathfinder reads hardware timer T0 (finding D5). The blocking call each tick makes the outcome the same; see Pathfinding for why a suspended search resumes identically | Observed | `path_service` 0x184de4–0x184df8, `path_search` 0x184324 |
| P14 | `water_disturb` is called from simulation code and writes ripple grids for the water chunks that have one (which chunks get a grid was not traced; *Inferred* to be decided by drawing). Its return value counts chunks whether or not they have a grid, but it is forced to 0 while `g_cutSkip` is set | Observed except as marked | 0x189514 |
| P15 | `decal_add` creates floor decals depending on the local option `g_decalDetail` (0x44fdc0); decals are written into the save by `decal_serialize` (from `save_writeLevelState`). The same option is read by creature death code 0x110d30 (0x1113fc, 0x1116bc, 0x1116f8) and `Player_processDamage` (0x1b31f4). The sites at 0x1113fc and 0x1b31f4 also accept `g_networkMode`, 0x1116bc requires an offline game; the decal site at 0x1116f8 has no network test and draws twice from a **fourth generator at 0x404468** | Observed; whether anything shared depends on the decals or on 0x404468 is Unknown (0x404468 is used by 7 functions, none in this range) | 0x19f158 |
| P16 | `engine_frameStep` returns the local frame cost (1 or 2). Callers in this range: `pad_updateRumble` only | Observed | 0x19e3a8 |
| P17 | `pauseMenu_task` is draw code driven by `g_rawPads`; `recall_execute`, reached from a game message, closes the pause menu of whichever machine runs it, sets `g_paused` to 0 and the input lockout 0x41b4fc to 60 | Observed | 0x18cc08, 0x18c230 |
| P18 | `cut_end` (moves players, deletes actors) is also called from the HUD draw task `hud_netStatusDraw` when the net session is being abandoned after a long stall | Observed; only on the way out of a broken session | calls at 0x1dbe64 and 0x1dc0b4 |
| P19 | `beam_create` records whether it was called inside a simulation tick (`g_inSimTick`) | Observed, cosmetic | 0x1932e4 |

Checked and found clean:

- **No function in 0x160000–0x1a0000 reads or writes the shared seed `g_randSeed` (0x404464).**
  Particle, trail, beam, water, weather and animation-sound code uses `g_cosmeticSeed` only
  (0x16d360, 0x16d558, 0x170cd8, 0x186e38, 0x1876e0, 0x18ba18, 0x192a40, 0x192c50, 0x192e80,
  0x193ad0, 0x195400). `ParticleMorphEffect_run` uses its own per-object generator from `run`.
- Animation, pathfinding and cutscene code does not read the camera to make a decision.
  `cut_evalCamera` reads the camera position only to preload the next shot.
- `cut_start` always sets the voice flag 0x44fcd1 to 1, so the wait-key logic is not gated by a
  local setting.
- Cutscene skip reads the lockstep pads (`g_pads`), not `g_rawPads`.
- Decoder slots of root-motion tracks cannot be stolen by drawing (`animcache_alloc`).

## Open questions

1. What the animation event bits mean per class. The engine only merges them; read the
   creature state handlers that receive the result of `Creature_stepAnim`.
2. P3/P4/P5: does a `Critter`'s position, a monster's idle event timing or a physics prop's
   resting place reach the sync hash? P3 looks the most direct; it needs the Critter run code
   (0x2547fc class, vtable 0x510ca0) read, or a two-machine run with VampireLord.
3. P6: can the lip-sync read really miss its key? Depends on disc timing; an emulator with a
   fast disc may never show it.
4. Camera during cutscenes (finding D7): `Camera_update` (0x203400) is called from
   `net_predictLocalPlayer`. `cut_start` sets the camera mode to 0 with `Camera_setMode`, but
   `Camera_update` still runs its transition branch when camera+0x48 is non-zero and can then
   call `camera_setView`. If that happens between ticks, `drawWorld`'s `camera_updateFocus`
   leaves a per-machine `g_cameraFocus` for the tasks that run before `cut_runTask` (priority
   300) in the next tick. Not traced further.
5. Cutscene header flags 2 and 4 (the three extra keys) and what object key types 3/4 do in
   each class (virtual slot 3).
6. Path request type 3 goal test (0x1846a4) and the two routines at 0x185448 and 0x1857e4.
7. Whether object key 10 really falls through into 11 and 12.
8. The creature field +0x3c4 written for the cutscene speaker (44000 / 1150).

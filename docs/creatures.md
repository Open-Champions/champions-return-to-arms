# Creatures: the Creature base class, AI helpers, weapon holders, clone functions

Area `creatures`, code 0x109d68–0x131d88 (320 functions). Symbols: `symbols/creatures.tsv`.
Read `docs/objects.md` first: a `Creature` is a `GameObject` (0x4c bytes) with 0x37c more.
Everything here was read from the executable; nothing was run. Claims are marked
**Observed** (read at the address given), **Inferred** or **Unknown** where it is not obvious.

## What is in the range

| Addresses | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0x109d68–0x10af28 | constructor, post-constructor setup, stat scaling |
| 0x10b048–0x10c0f0 | `Creature_draw`, turning, death/revive hooks, `Creature_updateActive` |
| 0x10c238–0x10f190 | **perception and target selection**: line-of-sight tests, cone searches, target/ally pickers |
| 0x10f2c8–0x112948 | loot, corpse handling, `Creature_processDamage` (the largest function, 6 KB) |
| 0x112948–0x1164c0 | `Creature_run`, movement (`moveBy`, `moveTo`, flee), knockback, animation step, path requests |
| 0x116638–0x118418 | damage intake, save/load state, interact, weapon-part helpers |
| 0x1185d8–0x11aaf8 | ~90 small helpers that monster classes call: predicates on the target, attack helpers, path access, status setters, spell-list access |
| 0x11abd0–0x11c180 | virtual functions of the three weapon holder classes `Weapon1`, `Weapon2`, `WeaponShield` |
| 0x11c1a0–0x131a40 | **117 clone functions** (virtual slot 15), one per class that adds fields |
| 0x131b00, 0x131cb8 | two netcode functions that happen to sit here |

How the pieces fit: a monster class (monsters area) overrides slot 4 (run), slot 5 (draw)
and slot 27 (set state). Its run calls `Creature_updateActive`, then usually
`Creature_run` (timers, status effects, follow logic), `Creature_processDamage`, a state
switch that uses the helpers below, `Creature_stepAnim` and `Creature_moveBy`. Its draw
calls `Creature_draw`. The base class's own slots 4 and 5 are empty stubs; `Creature_run`
and `Creature_draw` are ordinary functions (72 and 68 callers), not the virtual entries.

## Virtual slots: 39, not 92

See `docs/objects.md` for why the tool's count is wrong. Slots 1–16 are the `GameObject`
slots; the Creature bodies are listed here. Small bodies were emitted inline at
0x3c2688–0x3c2758 (runtime area).

### Creature flags at +0xa8 (64-bit)

| Mask | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x1 | MiniBoss property; boss rank 1 | ctor, `creature_bossRank` |
| 0x200 | blocking | `creature_isBlockedBy`, damage function |
| 0x800 | cannot be an enemy or an ally of anyone | slots 20, 21 |
| 0x1000, 0x2000, 0x4000, 0x8000, 0x10000, 0x20000, 0x40000 | body material: choose hit effect, gib and blood type (0x40000 = ordinary blood) | `Creature_processDamage`, `Creature_deadUpdate` |
| 0x100000 | no water/dust ground effects | `Creature_moveBy`, `Creature_applyKnockback` |
| 0x200000 | model not drawn by `Creature_draw` | 0x10b988 |
| 0x400000, 0x800000 | following a player, standing ahead / behind (script `followPlayer` sets 0x800000) | `Creature_run` |
| 0x1000000 | corpse sinks and is deleted once inactive | `Creature_deadUpdate`, tail of `Creature_run` |
| 0x2000000 | animation root motion not applied to the position | `Creature_stepAnim` |
| 0x4000000 | friendly (script `friendly`): picks no target, is nobody's enemy | slots 20, 23 |
| 0x8000000 | following a `PathName` path (script `followPath`) | `Creature_run` |
| 0x20000000 | no ice shatter, no gibs | `Creature_processDamage` |
| 0x40000000 | has `light1`/`light2`/`ambient` properties | ctor, `Creature_draw` |
| 0x80000000 | boss health bar is showing — **written from per-machine data**, see C3 | `Creature_run` 0x11399c–0x113ab8 |
| 0x100000000 | revived or loaded dead: gives no loot or experience | slot 32, `Creature_processDamage` |

Bits 0x10000–0x20000000000 not listed are set in monster constructors and were not traced.

### AI state (+0x232)

Only the numbers the base class itself tests are established: 0 idle; 1 entered when a
player touches an idle charmed creature; 3 a moving state whose animation rate is scaled
by 0x1bea10; 5 held in place (what a rooted creature is forced into); 6–15 attacking
(`Creature_isTargetAttackingMe`); 0x10 waiting out the attack cooldown; 0x13 stunned;
**0x14 dead** (set on death, by script `killMonster`, by the `dead` property and by a dead
save record). `Creature_filterState` 0x10a9c0 is the common filter derived `setState`
bodies call. **Observed.** Other numbers belong to the individual classes.

## Status effects

Three layers exist and they are easy to confuse.

**Frame timers** (+0x312…+0x31c, s16, one step per `Creature_run`): charm, root,
no-target, attack cooldown, spell speed, stun. All **Observed** in `Creature_run`
0x112c6c–0x112d64.

**Second timers** (+0x340…+0x354, float seconds, −1/60 per `Creature_run`): set through
`Creature_setEffectTimer(seconds, creature, which, source)` 0x118950. Burn and the two
damage-over-time timers deal damage through the damage function 0x1e8230 every 32nd frame,
and only when the creature is **not** the prediction copy (tests of 0x20000 at 0x1132f8,
0x113834, 0x1138d8). A burning *player* draws one `g_randSeed` value per tick; a monster
does not. **Observed.**

**The 16 status counters** at +0x36c (FINDINGS D12–D15). What this area adds:

- `Creature_draw` chooses a coloured glow from them in this order of precedence (later
  wins): counter 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13; counter 7 overrides all. It then decrements
  the **first non-zero counter in index order** unless that is index 12 or the game is
  frozen (0x10b898–0x10b8d4). **Observed.**
- `Creature_run` reads only counter 7 (+0x388): it becomes the slow amount, ramping at 2
  per frame from the start frame +0xf0, capped by resistance [4] and zeroed on death
  (0x113738–0x1137e4). **Observed.**
- No code in this range writes any counter except through whole-object copies (clone).

## Pending damage

`Creature_takeDamage` (slot 2) subtracts hit points at once **and** accumulates the same
amount in +0xc8 with the flags in +0x2dc. `Creature_processDamage` 0x110d30, called from
the class's run, reacts later in the same or the next frame: hit flash (flag 0x100), hit
effects chosen by cflags, optional gib objects, and at hit points ≤ 0 the death sequence:
flags 0x9, knockback speed from damage flag bits 0x40000 / 0x80000 / 0x100000 / 0x200000
(100 / 150 / 200 / 312.5), state 0x14, flag 0x2000, then (unless the creature has the
`Dead` property or cflag 0x100000000) experience for the players and a `GameObject_rand`
roll for an object dropped for the killer. Slot 28 (on death) and `Creature_dropLoot` are
not called from here; the monster classes call them. A creature with the IgnoreDamage flag
clears its second timers instead of taking damage; an inert creature (+0x231 ≠ 0) ignores
the call. **Observed.** Players use `Player_processDamage` instead.

## The attached-spell list (+0x364)

A handle list of `Spell` objects (spell: back-list head at +4, virtual table at +0x14,
caster at +0x18, skill id at +0x1c). `creature_addSpell` links one; `creature_findSpell`
and `creature_findSpellByType` search it; `creature_removeSpellByType` 0x11a6d0 deletes
one; the destructor deletes all. Three places walk it every frame: slot 17 (spell slot 2,
from `Creature_run`), `Creature_draw` (spell slot 3, **from draw code**, 0x10b928–0x10b970)
and the destructor. `Creature_clone` starts the copy's list empty (FINDINGS G2).
**Observed.**

## AI helper catalogue

All take the creature as their object argument; "target" is the object behind +0x234.
Arcs are 16-bit angles; ranges are world units. Full list with notes in the symbol file.

**Choosing who to attack**

| Address | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 0x10ded0 | `Creature_pickTarget` | slot 23. Keeps the current target while it is alive and still an enemy. Every 32nd frame (staggered by serial) or when forced: box query of ±HomeRange, candidates scored by slot 20 (+1 if last attacker, +1 if current target), ties broken by 2-D distance. If not damaged in the last 480 frames, candidates outside HomeRange of *home* are accepted only when within 60 units plus radii or when the creature is already farther from home than they are |
| 0x10e2c0 | `Creature_pickAlly` | slot 24, same idea with slot 21, box around home |
| 0x10cf78 | `creature_findEnemyInCone` | same scoring inside a cone, requires a clear terrain ray |
| 0x10ca70 | `creature_findPlayerInCone` | uncharmed: nearest visible live player from `g_players[0..n)` in slot order |
| 0x1124e0, 0x119d60 | `players_findNearestOnTeam`, `players_findFarthestWithin` | pick a player slot by distance |
| 0x119328 / 0x119400 / 0x10de10 | slots 20 / 21 / 22 | enemy / ally / same-team tests |

Nothing in these functions reads the camera, the local-player slot, or what was drawn. They
depend on the grid (box query order), on `g_players`, on the frame counter and on the
creature's serial number. **Observed.**

**Seeing**: `creature_canSeeObj` 0x10c810 and its variants (0x10c238, 0x10c410, 0x10c5b8),
wrappers on the target (0x118cb0–0x118d90), slot 25. All are arc + range + one terrain
ray (0x18a5c0).

**Predicates on the target**: attacking me 0x118e90, blocking 0x118f08, charging 0x118f90,
running away 0x119038, knocked down 0x1190e8, allies near it 0x119258.

**Moving**: `Creature_moveBy` 0x113c48 (the collision step), `Creature_moveTo` 0x114510
(path following with stuck recovery), `Creature_moveToDirect` 0x1155e0,
`Creature_moveToTarget` 0x1143e8, `Creature_moveToDest` 0x119f38, `Creature_moveToAlly`
0x119e98, `Creature_fleeFrom` 0x115910, `Creature_pickWanderDest` 0x119618,
`Creature_isAwayFromHome` 0x10eed8, `Creature_settle` 0x119e38, path access
0x11a020–0x11a1e0, `creature_findClearHeading` 0x10eaa8. Stuck recovery uses the
creature's own generator for the side step and `world_findFreeSpot` (shared seed) for the
last-resort teleport after 300 clock ticks.

**Attacking**: `Creature_hitTargetInArc` 0x119938 and relatives (0x1196e8, 0x119850,
0x119a20, 0x119b58) test geometry and call the damage function 0x1e8230 (gameplay area);
`Creature_knockbackTarget` 0x119d10; aiming helpers 0x11a920–0x11aaf8 lead the target by
its velocity and add a spread from the creature's own generator;
`creature_buildElementDamage` 0x1176e0 draws the shared seed once.

**Animation**: `Creature_stepAnim` 0x1162b0 advances the clip and extracts root motion;
`Creature_turnToward` (slot 26); `Creature_applyKnockback` 0x115eb8.

## Weapon holder classes

`Weapon1` (table 0x50cf40), `Weapon2` (0x50ce70) and `WeaponShield` (0x50cda0) are small
non-`GameObject` classes with 24 virtual functions and the table pointer at +0; a creature
points at one from +0x50. Slot 1 is **not** a destructor: it switches a hand on or off
(hand 1: byte +8 and bit 0 of +4; hand 2: byte +0x98 and bit 1). Slot 11 drops the held
model part as a `PhProp` (`creature_dropHeldPartAsProp` 0x117d30), slot 20 draws it
(0x117f08). The other slots are named `Weapon1_slotN` only; their bodies were not read.
Slots 2–8 are called by `Creature_init` for the `FireWeapons`, `FireBurstWeapons`,
`ColdWeapons`, `PoisonWeapons`, `ShockWeapons`, `DiseaseWeapons`, `NoMagicWeapons`
properties. **Observed** 0x10a3fc–0x10a5b0.

## Clone functions (slot 15)

Each is a compiler-generated copy constructor: `pool_new(size)`, copy every field,
`handle_initEmpty` for every handle. The class comes from the last virtual table the
function stores, the size from its `pool_new` argument, "copied after" from the table
stored just before (the nearest base that has its own copy step, not necessarily the direct
C++ base — the doors, for instance, derive from `WorldPart`). **Observed** for all 117.

Notes: 0x1309f0 is the function `names.tsv` calls `clone_50d590`; table 0x50d590 is
`Teleporter`. `Creature_clone` 0x11c298 is also slot 15 of 42 creature classes that add no
fields; `GameObject_clone` 0x11c1a0 of 55 plain classes; 0x11c7f8 of 16 projectile
classes; 0x12d498 of `LavaBomb`. Classes not in the table have no clone of their own. The
only virtual call of slot 15 is in `net_frameLoop` (0x13b540), for the prediction copy, so
for every class but `Player` these functions are never called.

## Per-machine state

| # | What | Kind | Addresses |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `Creature_draw` decrements a status counter and clears flag 0x100 from draw code (FINDINGS D12; flag 0x100 is read only by drawing) | Observed | 0x10b898–0x10b8d4, 0x10babc |
| C2 | `Creature_draw` calls virtual slot 3 of every attached spell. Any spell whose slot 3 changes shared state runs that change a per-machine number of times. The spell bodies are in the skills area and were not checked here | Observed call; effect Unknown | 0x10b928–0x10b970 |
| C3 | The MiniBoss block of `Creature_run` walks the list of alive **local** players (count 0x4f8424, slots 0x4f8430, filled only for `net_isLocalSlot` players by `game_rebuildAlivePlayers`) and, when one is within HomeRange, sets cflag 0x80000000 on the creature; otherwise clears it. That bit is object state written from per-machine data. Its only readers are this block and the script `setCFlag` helper 0x1445fc (which uses it to reset the HUD bar), and `Creature_saveState` does not store it, so no route into simulation was found | Observed write; harmlessness Inferred | 0x11399c–0x113ab8 |
| C4 | A path follower that has not reached its next point for 600 clock ticks is teleported there **if `isNearView(1000, pos)` is false**. `isNearView` uses the players except while `g_cullByCamera` is set, when it uses the camera focus (FINDINGS D6/D7) | Observed | call at 0x112c3c |
| C5 | `Creature_updateActive` → `obj_updateActive` decides whether a creature's AI runs; same camera dependence as C4 during cutscenes. Besides the AI, `Creature_spawnScavenger` keys on the inactive→active transition of a finished corpse and then draws `g_randSeed` and constructs a raven or rat (itself another `g_randSeed` draw) | Observed | 0x10c168; `Creature_spawnScavenger` 0x1125e0, called at 0x113ae4 |
| C6 | `Creature_processDamage` reads the options value 0x44fdc0 (`g_decalDetail` in other areas) three times. Each read is arranged so that object creation and `GameObject_rand` calls do not depend on it in a net game: the hit-blood branch takes the option **or** network mode (0x1113fc–0x111410); the "gibs because of the option" branch requires network mode off (0x1116bc); inside the gib branch the option only gates decals and effects 1/3/9, which use the cosmetic seed and a separate seed at 0x404468. The gib objects it creates are the ones in `docs/objects.md` O2 | Observed | 0x1113fc, 0x1116bc, 0x1116f8 |
| C7 | Burn and second-effect visuals are emitted from `Creature_run` only when the routine 0x13e180 (`net_objOrGhost` in the netcode symbols: for a local player it returns the prediction copy) returns the creature itself and flag 0x4000000 is clear. The two effect routines (0x1f5210, 0x1f61c0) use only `g_cosmeticSeed` | Observed; not a hazard | 0x113284–0x1132e8, 0x113550–0x1135b4 |
| C8 | Timed damage in `Creature_run` is skipped for the prediction copy (flag 0x20000), including the `g_randSeed` draw of a burning player | Observed; a guard | 0x1132f8, 0x113834, 0x1138d8 |
| C9 | `Creature_applyKnockback` gives players no knockback at all in a net game (and in PvP mode B) | Observed; a guard | 0x115ef4–0x115f04 |
| C10 | `Creature_interact`: the `shop` branch opens the shop menu only when the interacting slot is local (UI); the dialog branch sets `g_scriptActivePlayer` and runs a script, gated by a global latch 0x4fe53c. `Creature_trigger` uses the same latch. The latch's other writers were not traced | Observed; whether the latch is cleared from local UI code is Unknown | 0x116c30–0x116d2c, 0x11a5f0, latch routine 0x22fc04 (`menuMutex_tryAcquire` in the audio-save symbols) |
| C11 | `Creature_pickTarget` overwrites `g_excludeMask` with 8 for its box query and restores it (see objects O6) | Observed | 0x10e004–0x10e050 |
| C12 | `Creature_updateActive` runs `followLostScript` / `followFoundScript` on activity changes, but tests bits 0x400000/0x800000 of the **object** flag word, which are the message-set player bits, not the follow bits of the cflags word. For monsters the test therefore looks permanently false | Observed; that it is a bug is Inferred | 0x10c170–0x10c1e0 |

Checked and found free of camera, local-slot and drawn-set reads: slots 20–25, the cone
searches, the `players_*` pickers, `Creature_moveBy`, `Creature_moveTo`, `Creature_fleeFrom`,
`Creature_stepAnim`, `Creature_takeDamage`, `Creature_deadUpdate`. The effect spawner
0x1ef270 (`fx_spawn` in other areas) is called with ids 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 0xb, 0x10, 0x11,
0x12 from this area; only id 5 draws the shared seed or creates an object.

## Open questions

- Meaning of slots 35, 36 and 39, of +0xcc, +0xd4, +0xe4, +0xb4/+0xb5, +0x80, +0x2f8, and
  of resistances [0], [2], [3].
- Gameplay names of the +0x316 timer (slot 31), the +0x348 effect and the two
  damage-over-time timers; the callers are in the skills area.
- Who clears the dialog latch 0x4fe53c (C10).
- Whether any spell's slot 3 writes shared state (C2). `tools/vtab.py` on the Spell tables
  plus a scan of slot 3 bodies for stores would settle it.
- `Creature_dropLoot` 0x10f2c8, the second half of `Creature_processDamage`
  (experience and drop arithmetic, 0x111dd4–0x112494), `Creature_interactPrompt`, 0x10e720,
  0x114da0 (a `moveTo` variant with no direct callers), 0x10af28, 0x10bca8, 0x10bdb0,
  0x10ab18 and most Weapon-class slots were skimmed or not read.
- The two net functions at the end of the range (0x131b00, 0x131cb8) belong with netcode.

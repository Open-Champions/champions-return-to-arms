# "startup" area: picture cache, items and loot, creature movement helpers

Range `0x100000–0x109d68`, 53 functions, US `SLUS_209.73` v2.00. Static reading only;
nothing here was checked on a running game. **Observed** = read at the address given,
**Inferred** = follows from observations, **Unknown** = not established.

## What this range really is

It is not program start-up. It is the first object code in link order, and that code is
the **item module**: a streaming cache for item pictures, the item definition tables and
everything that builds, names, prices, generates and drops items. The last six functions
are creature movement and area-effect helpers that sit directly in front of the
`Creature` constructor (`0x109d68`).

How this was established:

- **Observed:** the ELF entry point is `0x14fa88` and `main` is `0x323dcc`; neither
  calls anything in this range directly (see "Start-up path" below).
- **Observed:** no data word in the executable holds the address of any of the 53
  entries (scan of both data segments), so none is a virtual function, a task, a script
  built-in or a static constructor. Everything here is reached by direct calls.
- **Observed:** the module's read-only strings start at the first byte of `.rodata`
  (`0x520000`, the two cache file names) and its tables start at the first byte of
  `.data` (`0x3e9c00`) and run to `0x402758`; its zero-initialised storage starts just
  after the start of `.bss` (`0x564380`). First in code, first in every data section.
- **Observed:** callers are loot code (`Creature_dropLoot` `0x10f2c8` and level objects
  in the monsters area), the script built-ins that give or drop items, the player's
  inventory and damage code, the shop and item-list UI, and save code.

Three functions have no caller and no pointer to them (**Observed**): `0x10404c`,
`0x105be8`, `0x108844`. They are leftovers.

## How the pieces fit

```

1. **Definitions** are constant 64-byte rows. An **item** is a 0x48-byte value that points
   at a definition and adds a count, a flag word, a prefix and suffix index and up to four
   numeric modifiers.
2. **`item_parseDescriptor` (`0x1069b8`)** is where every item starts. Its input is
   text: a definition name followed by `+token` modifiers. Random generation works by
   *building such a string* (base name + the prefix's modifier text + the suffix's
   modifier text) and parsing it (Observed, `0x104ca4`). Fixed gear is the same kind of
   text supplied by the caller: `player_giveStartingItems` alone has 323 call sites, and
   the script built-ins pass the script's own string.
3. **Generators** pick candidates with the shared generator `g_randSeed`, price each with
   `item_getValue` and keep the most valuable one that fits a gold budget.
4. **`loot_generateDrops` (`0x100d54`)** is the death-drop roll. It creates `Gold` objects
   and item props in the world.
5. **Pictures.** `item_buildPictureFilename` derives a texture file name; the
   **picture cache** streams it from `piccache.dat` in the background and
   `item_getPicture` returns a placeholder until it has arrived.
6. **Creature helpers** (`0x108970–0x109d67`): obstacle avoidance used by
   `Creature_moveTo`, an area-damage loop, a "count monsters near a point" query and a
   random relocation used by two monster classes.

## Data structures

### Item (0x48 bytes) — Observed in `0x1069b8`, `0x107ca8`, `0x108924`

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | ptr | definition row; a table index while saved (see `0x107ea4`) | `0x106b58`, `0x107ea4`, `0x107ec0` |
| +0x04 | s16 | count (stack size), from definition +0x0c | `0x106b4c`; multiplied into value and weight |
| +0x08 | u64 | flags, copied from definition +0x28; bits 11–15 are then replaced by the chosen visual variant | `0x106b50`, `0x1046e0` |
| +0x10 | s16[4] | zeroed on creation and copy; use Unknown | `0x106a40`, `0x107ca8` |
| +0x18 | s16[4] | zeroed on creation and copy; use Unknown | same |
| +0x20 | u8 | prefix row index, 0xff = none | `0x101e48`, `0x104ca4` |
| +0x21 | u8 | suffix row index, 0xff = none | same |
| +0x22 | s16 | zeroed by copy; use Unknown | `0x107ca8` |
| +0x24 | 4 × 8 bytes | modifiers: `s16 type` (0xffff = empty), `s16 v0, v1, v2` | `0x1069b8` tail `0x107b6c–0x107c40` |

Two items are "the same kind" for `0x108924` when definition, flags and the 32-bit word
at +0x20 match.

### Item definition (0x40 bytes), base table `0x3f7650` (607 rows + terminator)

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | char* | name; also the text key (`<name>_name`) | `0x1069b8`, `0x101e48` |
| +0x04 | s16 | level; generators require level ≤ their cap (values 1–107) | `0x104ca4`, `0x106214` |
| +0x08 | float | weight per unit | `0x103e08` |
| +0x0c | s16 | default count (20 on the ammunition row, 40 on 28 thrown-weapon rows, else 1) | `0x106b44` |
| +0x0e, +0x10 | s16, s16 | damage min, max; non-zero on all 162 weapon rows and no others | `0x104100`, table |
| +0x14 | s32 | fixed price; when ≥ 1 it replaces the value formula (set on ammunition, the thrown potions and 162 of the 209 category-2 rows) | `0x1024a8` first test |
| +0x18 | s16 | armour value; non-zero on exactly the 236 armour rows | `0x103ec8`, table |
| +0x1a | s16 | weapons only, near the mean damage; summed into player record +0xcc. Meaning Unknown | `0x103f88`, `0x1b721c` |
| +0x1c | u8 | equipment slot: 0 one hand, 2 two hands or ranged, 3 shield, 4 body, 5 ring, 7 neck, 8 ammunition, 9 gloves, 10 boots, 11 head, 12 legs, 14 ear, 16 none | Inferred from row names; used at `0x104c48`, `0x107edc` |
| +0x1d | u8 | category: 0 weapon, 1 armour, 2 everything else | every generator |
| +0x1e | u8 | weapon subtype: 0 one-handed, 1–3 two-handed families, 4 bow, 6 thrown (5 is excluded from the value formula) | `0x104c04`, `0x1024a8`, `0x108434` |
| +0x20 | u32 | damage-type bits (1, 4, 8); tested against a prefix's mask | `0x104c04`, `0x104ca4`; names Inferred: blunt, pierce, slash |
| +0x28 | u64 | flags, see below | |
| +0x30 | char* | picture base name, or 0 to use the model-table row's texture name | `0x107edc` |
| +0x34 | s16 | row in the model table `0x3e9ce0` | `0x1083f8` |
| +0x38 | ptr | filled at load for bows: their shot animation | `0x108434` |

Definition / item flag bits (bit numbers of the u64):

| Bit | Mask | Meaning | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | 0x200 | display name is never decorated with prefix or suffix (one row) | Observed `0x101e48` |
| 11–15 | 0xf800 | definition: number of visual variants; item: chosen variant | Observed `0x1046e0` |
| 16 | 0x10000 | never picked by the random generators | Observed, all generators |
| 19–22 | 0x80000… | armour material classes (cloth, leather, chain, plate); a prefix lists the classes it may attach to | Observed use `0x104ca4`; names Inferred from rows |
| 23 | 0x800000 | weapon picture uses the prefix's alternate colour index | Observed `0x107edc` |
| 33 | 0x200000000 | set on no definition; on an item it turns on a draw effect | Observed `0x1046c4`, `0x1068d8`; who sets it Unknown |
| 34 | 0x400000000 | weapon picture name is not varied (ammunition, thrown potions) | Observed `0x107edc` |
| 35 | 0x800000000 | "reagent" group (123 rows): only `0x106214` drops them | Observed |
| 36 | 0x1000000000 | model-table row = +0x34 plus the variant (3 rows) | Observed `0x1083f8` |
| 45 | 0x200000000000 | "figurine" group (20 rows): only `0x106658` drops them | Observed |

### The other tables (all Observed; row counts from walking to the null terminator)

| Address | Rows × size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `0x3e9c18` | 10 × 3 floats | drop quality rows: chance of a poor (budget ×0.5) and of a normal drop; the rest is good (×3). Row 0 is 99 % poor, row 9 is always good. `loot_generateDrops` interpolates between rows |
| `0x3e9cb0` | 7 floats | value multiplier per weapon subtype |
| `0x3e9cd0` | 16 bytes | draw-effect parameter block written by `0x1068d8` |
| `0x3e9ce0` | 134 × 16 | model table: model file name, texture file name, and two pointers filled by `item_loadResources` |
| `0x3ea550` | 835 × 0x40 | **preset table**: definitions whose *name is a full descriptor* (base name plus modifiers). Its terminator row ends exactly where the base table starts, so a preset has a negative index (−836…−2) under `0x107ea4`; `0x108968` returns 836 |
| `0x400e50` | 73 × 0x28 | prefixes: +0 text key, +4 s16 level, +6/+7/+8 s8 picture colour indices (weapon, armour, alternate weapon), +0x0c three modifier strings (one per category), +0x18 u64 definition-flag mask, +0x20 u32 damage-type mask |
| `0x4019e0` | 165 × 0x14 | suffixes: +0 text key, +4 s16 level, +8 three modifier strings (one per category) |
| `0x4026d8` | 12 ptrs | two- and three-letter body-type codes used in worn-armour picture names, indexed by the body-type argument of `0x107edc` (Inferred: the player model number, 0–11) |
| `0x402708`, `0x402730` | 9 ptrs each | mana and healing potion names, largest first |

### Modifier types — Observed, token → code pairs read from `0x106b90–0x107c48`

| Code | Token | Code | Token | Code | Token |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00–0x04 | resistfire, resistcold, resistpoison, resistdisease, resistmagic | 0x0e–0x13 | requiredlevel, requiredstrength, requiredintelligence, requireddexterity, requiredstamina, requiredclass | 0x1f–0x22 | fireburst, frostburst, poisonburst, lightningburst |
| 0x05–0x0a | healthbonus, manabonus, strengthbonus, intelligencebonus, dexteritybonus, staminabonus | 0x14 | attackspeed | 0x23 | damageincrease (percent) |
| 0x0b, 0x0c | healthregeneration, manaregeneration | 0x15–0x18 | firedamage, colddamage, poisondamage, shockdamage (min–max) | 0x24, 0x25 | weightmodifier, costmodifier (percent) |
| 0x0d | armorbonus (percent) | 0x19–0x1e | bugzapper, bugexploder, undeadbonus, undeaddestroy, critical, stunresistance | 0x26 | diseasedamage (min–max) |
| | | | | 0x27, 0x28, 0x2a | requiredblunt, requiredslashing, resistall |

A token carries one to three integers (`v0`, `v1`, `v2`). A repeated token overwrites its
slot; a fifth distinct token is silently dropped. A `mesh` token sets the visual variant
instead of adding a modifier. Code 0x29 is not produced by the parser.

### Picture cache — Observed in `0x100000–0x100973`

`piccache.hdr` (loaded whole, pointers fixed up in place):

| Where | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| header +0 | u32 | number of groups |
| group +0 (12 bytes each, from header +4) | ptr | this group's entries |
| group +4 | ptr | picture name stem |
| group +8 | u32 | number of entries |
| entry +0 (10 bytes each) | s16 | number after the stem, −1 if the name has none |
| entry +2 | u16 | first sector inside `piccache.dat` (2048-byte units) |
| entry +4 | u16 | sectors to read |
| entry +6, +8 | s16 | width, height |

Runtime state:

| Address | Size | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x3e9c00` | u8 | work pending (a slot is queued or loading) |
| `0x3e9c04` | s32 | slot being loaded; negative when none |
| `0x3e9c08` | u8 | set by the file system when the read has finished |
| `0x3e9c0c`, `0x3e9c10`, `0x5bf600` | | header allocation, group count, group array |
| `0x5b4600` | 64 × 0xc0 | slots: +0 name (empty = free), +0x40 s16 block list (−1 pending or terminator, −2 not in the header), +0x7c last-use display frame, +0x80 the 64-byte picture header that callers receive |
| `0x564600` | 256 × 0x500 | blocks: +0 tag word (quadword count ≤ 79, plus a "more follows" or "last" code), +4 pointer to the next block, +0x10 data. Byte 0 doubles as the in-use marker. Inferred: these are PS2 DMA chain packets so the picture can be uploaded without copying |
| `0x5b7600` | 0x8000 | read buffer; one read in flight at a time |

A picture header's +0x06 is its total quadword count and +0x14 receives the address of the
first block; +0x0a is stamped with a marker once the chain is built (`0x1003cc`).

### Fields of other structures used here

| Structure | Offset | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creature | +0x2f8 | u8 avoidance side: 0 none, 1 or 2 = steer to one side until all three probes are clear | `0x108a60` |
| Gold object (0xc0 bytes, vtable `0x511a88`) | +0x80 | amount | `0x157668` called from `0x100974` |
| Item prop (0x248 bytes, vtable `0x511ba8`) | +0x148 | embedded Item; +0xfc/+0x100 initial throw velocity | `0x155a0c`; stores at `0x101938`, `0x10194c` |
| Player record (`g_players[i]`) | +0x50 | class id; id 4 steers armour drops toward cloth | `0x104ca4`, `0x104758` |
| Shop stock list | +0x1200 | count of 0x48-byte items stored from +0 | `0x107d54` |

## The functions that matter

All 53 are named in `symbols/startup.tsv` with a one-line note each. The ones worth
reading first:

| Address | Name | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `0x1069b8` | `item_parseDescriptor` | 378 call sites; defines the Item layout and the modifier codes |
| `0x1046e0` | `item_randomizeVariant` | the hidden `g_randSeed` draw inside the parser |
| `0x100d54` | `loot_generateDrops` | the drop roll; order of seed draws below |
| `0x104ca4` | `item_generateWithAffixes` | the random-equipment generator (also shop stock, the script built-in givePlayerRandom, level objects) |
| `0x104758` | `item_generateFromSpecialTable` | preset ("named") items |
| `0x1024a8` | `item_getValue` | price; also the generators' budget test |
| `0x101e48` | `itemName_buildLocalizedName` | display name |
| `0x107edc` | `item_buildPictureFilename` | picture and equipment-texture names |
| `0x1003cc` | `picCache_serviceRequests` | the only thing in this range the main loop calls every frame |
| `0x108434` | `item_loadResources` | load-time set-up, with a side effect on `g_randSeed` |

### `loot_generateDrops` in order (Observed, `0x100d54–0x101997`)

Every random number is taken from `g_randSeed`. With more than one player the gold
amount is ×2.4, the gold chance ×1.5 and the equipment chance ×2 (`0x100dd8–0x100e3c`).

1. One draw selects quality (poor ×0.5, normal, good ×3) from the caller's quality row.
2. One draw selects 1, 2 or 3 gold rolls; each roll takes two draws (chance, amount) and
   may call `loot_spawnGold`. No gold in one PvP mode (`g_pvpModeA`).
3. Consumable: chance 7.5 % + 5 % per extra player (8 % + 6 % in the other PvP mode,
   `g_pvpModeB`). A second draw picks arrows or `item_generateConsumable`.
4. Reagent (flag 35): 1.25 %, or 0.8 % when the caller restricts it to one picture name.
5. Figurine (flag 45): 0.5 %.
6. Equipment: the caller's chance. Budget = quality × (0.8…1.2) × level factor × 200,
   tripled 1 % of the time and doubled 4 %. Category by one or two draws. 3 % of the time, or
   when the caller forces it, a preset item; otherwise `item_generateWithAffixes`. The
   prop is thrown in a random direction within ±45° of the given angle.

Steps 4 and 5 `return` from the whole function when their chance succeeds but no
definition qualifies, skipping the later steps (branches at `0x101320`, `0x10134c`,
`0x1014bc`). Each object created draws `g_randSeed` again in its constructor (see
OVERVIEW).

### `item_generateWithAffixes` (Observed, `0x104ca4`)

Counts players of class 4; for armour this decides whether cloth is excluded or
preferred. Rolls a weapon group (7 % thrown with a fifth of the budget, 5 % group 1,
88 % the rest) or one of six armour slots. Then 10 tries (15 for weapons): pick a random
eligible definition and a random suffix whose level fits; the first try is the plain
item, later tries build one candidate per eligible prefix (category 2 takes a simpler
path: one candidate per try, suffix only). Each candidate is parsed and
priced; unless it is a potion it also receives a `requiredlevel` modifier computed from
its value (capped at 80). The best candidate not above the budget wins and
`item_randomizeVariant` finishes it.

### `item_getValue` (Observed outline, `0x1024a8`)

Fixed price × count when the definition has one. Otherwise a base (weapons: from the
damage range and the weapon modifiers, times the subtype multiplier; armour: from
`item_getArmorValue`, halved for shields; other: 5) is raised to a fixed power, a term
per remaining modifier is added (a `costmodifier` scales the running total by a
percentage), and the sum is multiplied by 40, by 0.004 for thrown stackables (name
contains the spear stem, or definition flag bits 42–44), by about 8 for the jewellery
slots, then by the count. The constants are in the function; they were not all
transcribed.

### Display names (Observed, `0x101998–0x1024a7`)

`itemName_buildLocalizedName(item, decorated)` writes UTF-16 into one static buffer
(`0x564420`). Text comes from the string table by key (`<definition name>_name`, the
prefix key, the suffix key). The language byte `0x44fddc` selects the word order and
whether the prefix must agree with the noun: the noun's text ends in an underscore tag
that `itemName_stripGrammarSuffix` removes and turns into a form number, and
`itemName_getAffixForm` picks that form from a bar-separated prefix text. Inferred:
language 4 is German (one-letter tags, three genders plus plural), 1 and 3 are Romance
languages (two-letter gender+number tags), everything else uses English order with the
literal "of" key between noun and suffix.

## Start-up path, and when code in this range runs

None of this is inside the range; it is here because the range was thought to be it.

| Step | Address | What happens | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `0x14fa88` | ELF entry. Zeroes `.bss` `0x564300–0x90a434`, makes two kernel calls (numbers 0x3c, 0x3d), calls the library initialiser `0x35c2a0`, flushes the cache, enables interrupts, calls `main` with argc/argv from `0x5f8740`, passes the result to the exit routine `0x3b3828` | Observed; the kernel calls being thread and heap set-up is Inferred from the standard Sony start-up module |
| 2 | `0x323dcc` | `main` (debug markers name its source file `core.cc`). Calls a run-once routine first (`0x3ad310`; Inferred: the static-constructor walker), initialises subsystems and message handlers, loads the always-resident lumps (fonts, text, interface, effects, engine), runs two modal presentation callbacks (`0x321640`, `0x321788`), reads the switches `--splash`, `--net`, `--stress`, and when not started with `--net` builds default player records (`0x323a3c`, called at `0x3241d4`) | Observed `0x323e10–0x3241d4` |
| 3 | `0x3241f4–0x324278` | `main`'s endless loop: unload low-priority lumps (`0x1713c0(5)`), enter the front end the first time when offline (`frontend_start` `0x1e1f34`), run one **session** (`0x322998`), then re-enter the front end according to the session's exit code | Observed |
| 4 | `0x322998` | Session start. **Offline: `g_cosmeticSeed` and `g_randSeed` are both loaded from the CPU cycle counter (COP0 Count) at `0x3229f0` and `0x322a00`. Net game: only `g_cosmeticSeed` is set, to 0 (`0x3229e8`).** Registers the session's tasks | Observed |
| 5 | `0x322d24–0x323104` | When a world name is pending: in a net launch `net_startSync` (`0x13dce0`, called at `0x322d8c`) sets `g_randSeed = 0`; `mainloop_loadRequestedWorld` (`0x320edc`, called at `0x322e30`) calls `game_loadLevel` (`0x1e55c0`); a warm-up loop draws frames while resources stream in; a net game waits for the peers; for the four store worlds the shop stock is generated (`shop_openOrStock` at `0x3230c4` or `0x3230f0`) | Observed |
| 6 | `0x3231d8–0x3234d0` | The per-frame part: simulate (offline `tasks_run`, net `net_main`), run draw tasks, service audio, files and **`picCache_serviceRequests` (`0x323378`)**, flip | Observed |
| 7 | `0x3234e0–0x3235a7` | Session exit: tear-down, ending with **`picCache_freeHeader` (`0x323570`)** | Observed |

`names.tsv` gives `main_loop` as `0x32316c`. That address is an instruction in the middle
of step 5 (a resource lookup), not a function entry and not the loop head; the function is
`0x322998` and the per-frame branch starts at `0x3231d8` (also noted in
`docs/mainloop.md`).

When this range's code runs:

| When | What | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| In `main`, before the first session, offline boot only | `item_parseDescriptor` (and through it `item_randomizeVariant`): `0x323a3c` sets the player count to 1 (4 with a switch) and calls `player_initNewCharacter` at `0x323cf4`, which ends in `player_giveStartingItems` | Observed call chain `0x3241d4` → `0x323cf4` → `0x1b2400` → `0x1acc78`. The seed it advances is overwritten at session start (step 4) |
| Inside `game_loadLevel`, only for a world other than the front-end world and only if `hud.lmp` is not already loaded (`0x1e5690–0x1e56ac`) | `item_loadResources` (`0x1e56bc`), then `picCache_loadHeader` (`0x1e56c4`) | Observed. Inferred: that is the first game world after boot or after a visit to the front end, because loading the front-end world (`0x1e5738`) and leaving a session (`0x32353c`) unload that lump group |
| Later in `game_loadLevel`, after those | `g_cosmeticSeed = g_randSeed` (`0x1e59b4`) | Observed |
| After a store world has loaded | generators, through `shop_openOrStock` | Observed `0x3230c4`, `0x3230f0` |
| Every displayed frame | `picCache_serviceRequests` | Observed `0x323378` |
| Session exit | `picCache_freeHeader` | Observed `0x323570` |

That first row is the earliest execution of anything in the range. With `--net` it is
skipped and the first execution is inside the first world load.

## Per-machine state

Scan result first. **Observed:** no instruction in `0x100000–0x109d68` reads COP0, a
hardware register (`0x1000xxxx`) or makes a kernel call, and no function here references
`g_cosmeticSeed`, the camera, the pads, audio state or the local-player slot (every global
reference in the range was listed). The module does not seed any generator. What it does
do:

1. **`g_randSeed` is advanced by a resource loader, behind a per-machine condition.**
   `item_loadResources` parses all 607 base definitions with variant −1 (`0x108524`);
   the parser then calls `item_randomizeVariant` (`0x107c78`), which draws from
   `g_randSeed` for each definition that has visual variants — 223 draws. The call is
   made only when `hud.lmp` is not loaded on *this* machine (`0x1e56a4–0x1e56ac`), and in
   a net launch it comes after the seed was zeroed (`0x322d8c`), so it is part of the
   starting state of the game. **Observed** (mechanism). **Inferred:** harmless when
   every machine reaches the first world from the front end, because then all of them
   make the same 223 draws. **Unknown:** whether any flow lets one machine keep that lump
   group loaded while another does not; if one exists the machines start 223 draws apart.
2. **The parser draws from `g_randSeed` whenever its variant argument is −1** — almost
   every call. **Observed.** Any caller that runs on one machine only, or from draw or
   menu code, would move the shared seed. Callers not classified here: the store stock
   calls in the session function (`0x3230c4`, `0x3230f0`; not a run task, placed after the
   net ready-wait loop), `player_giveStartingItems` (`0x1acc78`), object constructors at
   `0x152a18`, `0x155dac`, `0x159458`, and the monster and skill callers listed by
   `tools/ps2elf.py xref 1069b8`. **Unknown** per caller.
3. **Picture availability differs per machine.** The cache is driven by local disc
   completion (`0x3e9c08`), is serviced once per *displayed* frame and evicts by the
   per-machine display-frame counter `0x44fdd0` (`0x1002d4`). `item_getPicture` returns
   the real picture or a placeholder accordingly (`0x108388`). **Observed.** Its callers
   are the item-list drawing functions `0x1cc7e0`, `0x1cd208`, `0x1cbbe8`; **Inferred:**
   display only.
4. **`item_buildPictureFilename` is also used for worn-equipment textures**
   (`0x1a30b0`, `Player_drawEquipped` `0x1a3580`, `0x1bc768`, `0x1be7e8`), and the session
   warm-up loop waits on `0x1a30b0` per machine (`0x322f64`). **Observed** callers; the streaming
   itself is outside this range and was not read.
5. **Draw code writes a global.** `item_selectDrawEffect` (`0x1068d8`) fills the
   parameter block `0x3e9cd0` and the engine's effect selector from draw functions
   (vtable slot 5 at `0x15991c`, `Player_drawEquipped`, `WeaponRack_draw`). **Observed.**
   Nothing in this range reads the block back; **Inferred:** cosmetic.
6. **Language-dependent text.** Names depend on `0x44fddc`, a per-machine setting, and
   live in static buffers (`0x564420`, `0x564380`). **Observed.** Callers are the item
   props' prompt virtual (slot 13: `0x154d10`, `0x159870`) and `itemList_drawRows`;
   **Inferred:** display only.
7. **No test for the prediction copy (flag 0x20000) anywhere in the range.**
   `loot_spawnGold`, `loot_spawnNamedItem`, `loot_generateDrops`,
   `combat_applyAreaDamage`, `Creature_relocateAlongClearRay` and
   `Creature_computeAvoidanceOffset` (which writes creature +0x2f8) all change shared
   state unconditionally. **Observed.** Whether the copy can reach them depends on the
   callers: `combat_applyAreaDamage` ends in `damage_apply`, which refuses the copy as
   attacker (per `symbols/gameplay.tsv`); `Creature_dropLoot` and the monster callers
   were not checked. **Unknown.**
8. **Item identity is a pointer while in memory** (`0x108924`), converted to a table
   index for saving (`0x107ea4`). **Observed.** Both tables are constant data at fixed
   addresses, so the pointers are equal on every machine running this executable;
   **Inferred:** not a hazard.

For context, on the start-up path outside the range (**Observed**): the offline seeds
come from COP0 Count (`0x3229f0`, `0x322a00`); in a net game the cosmetic seed is 0 at
session start and the shared seed is 0 after `net_startSync`; `game_loadLevel` then copies
the shared seed into the cosmetic one (`0x1e59b4`), so on a net launch both generators
start from values fixed by the load sequence, not by a clock. The main loop reads timer
T0 twice per frame (`0x32321c`, `0x323274`) only to store a duration at `0x44fd48`.

## What the area should be called, and its boundaries

- **Name:** `items` ("picture cache, item definitions, generation, loot, naming").
  The current label "program start, early engine setup" is wrong.
- **Start `0x100000`:** correct; it is the first function of `.text`.
- **End:** the item code ends at `0x10896f`. The six functions `0x108970–0x109d67`
  use no item data and no strings; they take creatures, write a `Creature` field
  (+0x2f8) and are called from `Creature_moveTo`, `Creature_moveToDirect`,
  `Creature_fleeFrom` and monster `run` functions. They belong to **creatures**, whose
  range should start at `0x108970`. Inferred: they are free helpers at the top of the
  creature source file; no symbol or string proves the file boundary.
- The picture cache (`0x100000–0x100973`) is a self-contained unit and could be listed
  separately; its only clients in this range are `0x108358` and `0x1083a4`.

## Not done

- `item_getValue`: structure read, constants not all transcribed, no worked example.
- `item_buildPictureFilename`: the armour branch (body-type selection, circlet special
  cases) was read once and is summarised, not verified case by case.
- The six creature helpers were read from the decompile only; their ray-cast callees
  (`0x18ad94`, `0x18a5c0`, `0x183820`) were not opened.
- `main`'s initialisation calls (step 2) were listed, not read.
- Callers were classified by area and name, not read, except where stated.

## Open questions

1. Item +0x10 and +0x18 (two `s16[4]` arrays) and +0x22: who writes them after creation?
   Search writers at item-relative offsets inside the inventory lists (record +0x130,
   stride 0x48).
2. Definition +0x1a: what does player record +0xcc feed? That names the field.
3. Who sets item flag bit 33 (no definition has it)? It drives the draw effect and
   `item_getFlag33Level`.
4. Per-machine item 1: can `hud.lmp`'s lump group be loaded on one net peer and not on
   another when the first world loads? Reading the lump priority code (`0x1713c0`,
   `0x17128c`) and the net launch path in `frontend_run` would settle it.
5. Per-machine item 2: are the store stock calls at `0x3230c4`/`0x3230f0` reached with the same
   `g_randSeed` on every machine? It follows a wait loop that calls `net_main`.
6. The meaning of language codes 1, 3 and 4, and whether the US disc can select them.
7. `0x101c0c` is inert in this build (its state word is never set). Was it live in the
   engine's earlier game?
8. Can the prediction copy reach `Creature_computeAvoidanceOffset` through
   `Creature_moveTo` and friends from `Player_run`?

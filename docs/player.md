# Player: the Player class and the per-player record

Address range 0x1a0000–0x1c0000 (122 functions). Symbols are in `symbols/player.tsv`.
Everything here was read from the executable; nothing was run. Each statement is
**Observed** (read at the address given), **Inferred** or **Unknown**.

## What the area does

Two things live side by side and are easy to confuse:

- The **Player object** — a `Creature` (0x3c8 bytes) extended to 0x590 bytes, created by
  `Player_ctor` (0x1a1d28), one per player in the level. It holds position, animation and
  the short-lived state of whatever the player is doing. It is destroyed and re-made on
  death/respawn and on every level change.
- The **player record** — 0x4c30 bytes per slot in `g_players` (0x4d8af0). It holds the
  character: name, class, statistics, hit points and mana, three item bags, equipment
  pointers, ability records, skill ranks, mission progress. The object finds its record
  through its slot index (object +0x3c8); the record points back at the object (+0x43d8).

`Player_run` (0x1a5030, virtual slot 4) is the per-frame simulation of one player. It runs
once per simulated frame for every real player and, on each machine, extra times on the
prediction copy of that machine's own player (object flag 0x20000). The second half of this
document is the audit of what the copy can change.

The start of the range (0x1a00b0–0x1a1b38) is not player code: floor decals, a menu list
widget and the handle-list node pool. The end of the range (0x1bfbc8 on) belongs to the
inventory user interface.

## The player record (`g_players[slot]`, 0x4c30 bytes)

Offsets are from the start of the record. "init" = `player_initNewCharacter` 0x1b1d70,
"import" = `player_importCharacter` 0x1bd458, "stats" = `player_recalcStats` 0x1b6458.

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | char[0x20] | character name | Observed: init copies the name argument here (string copy 0x3b868c); import copies 0x20 bytes |
| +0x20 | s8[4] | appearance choices (-1 = none); select the model part files | Observed: `Player_ctor` builds four part names from them (0x1a1d28) |
| +0x24 | char[] | name of the level to return to after a recall; default is a 5-byte constant at 0x5375d0 | Observed: init/import copy the constant; `player_recallTick` 0x1b5fa0 stores and reads it |

The whole record is sent to the other machines at launch: `player_packRecord` 0x1be0d0
compresses runs of zero bytes and `player_unpackRecord` 0x1bfa38 expands them (callers
`net_launchTransfer` 0x134c60 and 0x135638). **Observed.** So every machine holds the same
four records, but the four records differ from each other.

### Item record (0x48 bytes)

Slots of other classes that `Player_run` relies on (**Observed** at the call sites):
creature slot 12 (table +0x60) "you are being aimed at" with kind 2 (ranged) or 3 (melee);
slot 17 (+0x88) set aim point; slot 26 (+0xd0) turn toward a point. `Skill` (table at
skill +0x60): slot 1 "can this player use it", slot 2 cast (returns a Spell), slot 5 mana
cost for a rank. `Spell` (table at spell +0x14): slot 1 with argument 3 ends it.

## The action state machine (+0x58c)

| State | Meaning | Entered from | Left to |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | ranged attack: bow shot, or throw when +0x480 is 7 | state 2 with a bow or thrown weapon and the attack button (0x1a7b04 on); Player slot 27 | 2 when the animation flag clears and the minimum interval has passed |
| 1 | melee swing and combo | state 2 (attack button, or heavy attack skill 0x25) | 2 at the end of the swing; 8 if block is held |
| 2 | neutral: standing or moving; every action starts here | constructor; end of every other state | 0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 0xc |
| 3 | staggered or knocked down | `Player_processDamage` 0x1b2ed8 and 0x1b380c | 2 when the hit animation ends |
| 4 | dead | `Player_processDamage` 0x1b34fc | never; the object is replaced by `player_respawn` 0x1bd040 |
| 5 | casting an ability | state 2 | 2 when released, finished, refused or out of mana |
| 6 | under control of a skill (leap-type skills supply the velocity) | skill code 0x2d17c8, 0x2de640, 0x2e09b4, 0x2face4, 0x30016c, 0x301714, 0x303254 | the same skills set 2 |
| 7 | airborne (a jump impulse, then falling) | no direct store of 7 found; Unknown | 2 on landing (`Player_move`) |
| 8 | blocking | states 1, 2, 0xb when block is held and `player_canBlock` | 2 on release; 0xb |
| 9 | rush forward (movement mode 2); contact handled by `Player_onTouch` | skill code 0x2c8864 | skill code |
| 10 | ground-pound style skill; animation events do area damage | state 2 older skill id 0xc; skill code 0x2c71ec | 2 |
| 0xb | block move: swap button pressed while blocking | `Player_tryBlockMove` 0x1bf150 | 8 or 2 |
| 0xc | war-cry (older skill id 0xe) | state 2 | 2 |
| 0xd | riding a vehicle | 0x208f08 | 2 (the copy predicts the dismount button) |
| 0xe | skill-held state with no handling in `Player_run` | 0x311638 | skill code |

All **Observed** in `Player_run`'s switch at 0x1a5e80 and the stores listed; the short
English names are mine.

Order of work in `Player_run` each frame: `Creature_run`; mirror hp to object +0x228;
timers; idle voice; choose the pad (a zeroed pad at 0x8667f0 replaces the real one while
controls are locked); aura light fade; potion buttons; ability button selection; health and
mana regeneration and item timers; kill plane; `Player_processDamage`; weapon swap and
interact; the state switch; aura light; `Player_updateCast`; record countdowns.

Two net-game differences inside the state machine (**Observed**): the melee hit is applied
on frame 1 of the swing instead of at 16 frames ÷ attack speed (0x1aa6ec–0x1aa738), and the
ranged release time is halved (0x1a80e0 on). Movement speed is 0.75 instead of 0.861945.

## Per-machine state

### Places where shared state can be changed differently on one machine

1. **The copy's death rebuilds the alive list.** `Player_processDamage` calls
   `game_rebuildAlivePlayers` at 0x1b3504 with no test for the copy; `Player_run` calls
   `Player_processDamage` at 0x1a5b90, also unguarded. The rebuild reads the object pointer
   in each record, which during prediction is the copy, and drops slots whose object has
   the dead flag. The table pointer, hp and mana are restored after prediction but the
   list is not; `tasks_run` (0x3226e4) rebuilds it only at the *end* of each simulated
   frame. **Observed.** Consequence: after the copy dies in prediction, the next simulated
   frame on that machine runs with its own player missing from `g_alivePlayers` while the
   other machines still have it. About 50 functions read that list (monsters, scripts,
   skills). **Inferred** to desynchronise. The copy can die ahead of the real player
   through the kill plane, which is applied to the copy too (0x1a5b38–0x1a5b8c writes
   1,000,000 pending damage, no guard) — **Observed** — or if it was cloned while damage
   was pending — **Inferred**. This is G10 without the restriction to PvP. Also at
   0x1b351c the copy's death calls `net_closeLocalMenus(1)` (local UI only).
2. **`mission_getMedal` reads the local player's record.** 0x1bf838 calls
   `net_getLocalPlayerSlot` (0x1bf868) and reads that record's medal byte unless its third
   argument is set. Script built-ins `getMedal` (0x142188) and `runMedalSuccess` (0x1417a4,
   call at decompile line 64) pass 0; nine level scripts (`*MEDAL`) call `getMedal`.
   **Observed.** Each record carries its owner's medals, so two machines can get different
   answers inside a lockstep script. **Inferred** hazard; only the medal levels are
   affected. (Callers 0x231360, 0x2313b4, 0x231438 pass 1 and read slot 0.)
3. **`Player_castSkill` runs some skills for the copy.** For the copy, a skill whose flag
   word (+4) has bit 0 set has its cast function called (0x1a4598, vslot 2) and the
   returned spell is destroyed straight away (0x1a45d0). Anything else the cast
   function changes stays changed. **Observed.** Which skills carry bit 0 is set by static
   constructors and was not read — **Unknown**. Their "can use" functions (vslot 1) are
   called for the copy from 0x1a4358, 0x1a5d54, 0x1a7088 and 0x1ab618 as well and must be
   free of side effects.
4. **Older ability paths have no test for the copy.** They are taken only by ability
   records whose name is not the `Skill` marker (see D15/D16 for whether any character
   has one). **Observed**, all in `Player_run`:
   - 0x1a74b0 stores 1 to record +0x4a7c (active weapon set) for skill ids 4, 5, 6, 0x12,
     0x13;
   - 0x1a67b4 (state 0xc), 0x1abe68, 0x1ac120, 0x1ac378 create a `LightEffect` object;
     0x1ac02c creates a projectile-class object (0x293704); 0x1ac164 creates an
     `UnholyAura` (0x29486c). The object constructor's draw from `g_randSeed` is restored,
     the object itself stays in this machine's world;
   - 0x1ac400 does area damage (0x161270).
   The status-counter stores on the same paths (0x1a71c4, 0x1abda0, 0x1abe90, 0x1ac068)
   go to the copy's own object while predicting and are not shared state.
   The matching code for the heavy attack (0x1a73e4) and for state 10 (0x1a6950,
   0x1a69bc) *is* guarded, which suggests the unguarded paths are leftovers.
5. **Target notification from the copy.** In state 1 the chosen target's slot 12 is called
   with kind 3 at 0x1aa5b8, no guard (the ranged equivalent with kind 2 is guarded).
   **Observed.** No class handles kind 3 today (the ten overrides test only kinds 0 and 2),
   so this is latent.
6. **Script hook from the copy.** 0x1a90f0 runs the arrow-shot notify script by name with
   no guard. **Observed.** No level script on the disc defines it; latent.
7. **Record +0x4a5c** is written by the copy (0x1a6270, 0x1a629c, 0x1a8078, 0x1a8084).
   Already G8; nothing reads it.
8. **`Player_takeDamage` early-outs** (0x1b536c–0x1b53f4) on `g_recallCountdown`, the
   jump-gate state 0x500ae8 (through 0x27dd68), `g_menuInputLockout` 0x41b4fc and
   `g_exitCountdown` 0x4f694a. **Observed.** If any of these differs between machines for
   one frame, damage is dropped on one machine only. Not established here whether they
   can differ: 0x41b4fc is zeroed at the top of every net tick; 0x4f694a and the recall
   countdown are set by game message handlers. **Unknown.**

### Per-machine reads that only reach local presentation (checked)

- `Player_draw` writes object +0x464 and the globals at 0x4d8a30/0x4d8a38; `Player_run`
  reads +0x464 only to decide whether to run `Player_weaponTrails` (0x1a5638).
  **Observed**; trails use the cosmetic seed.
- `Player_draw` calls `Player_interact` in display mode for the local slot (0x1a4800). In
  that mode it writes only the prompt globals (0x4d8ac0, 0x4d8ad0, text at 0x864f50) and
  never `g_scriptActivePlayer`. **Observed.** It does call slot 13 (prompt) of nearby
  objects from draw code; those functions belong to other areas and were not read.
- `player_voice` 0x1b7ba8 reads `net_isLocalSlot`, `g_localMenuOpen` and the audio status;
  it writes only the cosmetic seed. **Observed** (ghostreach lists no other store).
- State 1 uses `net_isLocalSlot` (0x1aa6f4) only to choose the frames on which swing
  sounds play; those sounds draw from a third generator at 0x404468 (0x1aa990), which is
  therefore not synchronised. **Observed.** Other users of 0x404468 (0x110d30, 0x24c994,
  0x284b68, 0x2c7808, 0x2eec08, 0x308578) were not read.
- `Player_animStep` passes no position for the machine's own real player (object flag
  0x200000), which makes the animation code skip sound cues and not advance the cue
  cursor; the returned event bits do not depend on it. **Observed** (0x16d748).
- `Player_move` takes the camera yaw from the per-slot word at 0x5d0bc0 (0x13e0c8), which
  `net_frameLoop` fills from the input record (0x13ac9c). The screen-edge clamp
  (`Player_clampToScreen`, view planes) is used only when `g_networkMode` is 0.
  **Observed.**
- The aura globals (0x4d8a40–0x4d8ab0, 0x8659a0) and the HUD message timers 0x41b840 /
  0x41b8c0 (0x1a75d0) are advanced by the copy too; their only readers are `Player_draw`,
  `Player_run`'s own light code and the HUD. Floor decals added in state 4 (0x1ab4b4) and
  `hud_showMessage` calls (0x1a6ebc, 0x1a7af0, 0x1a8040, 0x1aafc4) are likewise
  unguarded and local. **Observed.**

### Checked and found guarded against the copy

Potion use (0x1a5998, 0x1a59f0; G8). Weapon swap and interact (0x1a5bf0, 0x1a5c1c). Health
and mana regeneration and item timers (tests inside 0x1b3b90, 0x1b3900, 0x1bc560). Hit
immunity countdown (0x1a5368). Ability button selection (0x1a5a44–0x1a5aac). Thrown
projectile creation, ammunition count and item removal (0x1a86f0, 0x1a881c, 0x1a8884,
0x1a8958). Arrow creation, arrow count, item removal and the ammunition pointer (0x1a9240,
0x1a9344, 0x1a944c, 0x1a9520, 0x1a9544). Ranged target notification. `Player_meleeHit`
(returns for the copy). Heavy-attack `LightEffect` (0x1a73e4). State 10 area damage and
`GroundPoundEffect` (0x1a6950, 0x1a69bc). State 6 skill polling. The record countdowns at
the end (0x1ac6e8–0x1ac74c). `Player_onTouch`. In `Player_processDamage`: the blood prop
and the knock-back skill. In `Player_move`: the rush contact call.

Writes that the prediction loop restores and so need no guard: every `g_randSeed` draw in
`Player_run` and its direct callees (0x1a549c, 0x1a64c4, 0x1a8420 … 0x1ab490, and in
0x1bba88, 0x1bc2f8, 0x1bcc20, 0x1b4020, 0x1b2cc0), and the mana stores at 0x1a5b04,
0x1a7278, 0x1a94ac, 0x1ab6c0 and in `Player_castSkill`.

## Not read

`Creature_run` and everything under it, creature move/collide 0x1186d8, the damage function
0x1e8230, the `net_closeLocalMenus` subtree, `Projectile_runThrown` 0x1ba940,
`player_giveStartingItems` 0x1acc78 (20 KB of item grants), `Player_recalcDamage` beyond
its interface, `Player_drawEquipped` 0x1a3580 (decompile failed), the equipment-cache
functions in detail, and the menu list widget. Of ghostreach's 812 reachable functions I
checked the direct callees of `Player_run` and the player-record writers; the deeper
engine, sound and library entries were judged by what they write, not read.

## Open questions

- Which `Skill` objects have flag bit 0 (run for the copy)? Read the static constructors
  that fill the objects at 0x6e14d8 onward, or dump skill +4 from a memory snapshot.
- Does creature move/collide (0x1186d8) call the "touched" slot of other objects when the
  mover is the copy? That would be shared state changed by the copy.
- State 7: what sets it? No store of 7 to +0x58c exists as a constant; look for a computed
  store or a clone from another object.
- State 0xd for the copy calls the vehicle's slot 17 with the player's position (0x1a5efc)
  and then 0x14f028 (0x1a5f04); whether the vehicle is changed by that is not established.
- Record +0x58 versus +0x59, +0xe8–0xee, +0x128, +0x3748, +0x43d0: meanings.
- Which button is the health potion and which the mana potion (`g_btnPotionA/B`).
- Whether `player_importCharacter` reads the previous game's save format (layout and the
  level cap of 50 suggest it — Inferred).
- names.tsv calls 0x1309f0 `clone_50d590`; vtables.txt gives table 0x50d590 to class
  `Teleporter`.

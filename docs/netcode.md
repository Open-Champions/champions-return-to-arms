# netcode — lockstep loop, prediction, input codec, peers, game messages (0x131d88–0x13ecf8)

54 functions. Everything here was read from the decompile and the disassembly; nothing was
seen on a running game. Names are in `symbols/netcode.tsv` (41 functions, 40 globals) and
`names.tsv` (13 functions that were already named). Unless a line says *Inferred* or
*Unknown*, a statement is *Observed* at the address given.

## Summary

- The game's own netcode is a peer-to-peer deterministic lockstep for up to four machines.
  Each machine samples its pad once per rendered frame, stores it as an input record for a
  future frame, and the simulation only runs a frame when it holds that frame's record from
  every peer that has not been dropped.
- **Transport.** Lockstep traffic does not go through SOE's UdpLibrary. `net_sendInputPacket`
  and `net_pumpReceive` call the Sony libnet stubs `sceInetSendTo` 0x365830 and
  `sceInetRecvFrom` 0x365670 directly on a socket the game opens itself (`sceInetCreate`
  0x3654a8 with type 0 and a local port — the same call UdpLibrary's PS2 driver uses for its
  own UDP socket at 0x3958c0). So input, sync hashes and game messages are plain unreliable
  datagrams; the reliable-channel resend timer in FINDINGS L2 plays no part. Reliability is
  done by repetition: every input packet carries all frames the receiver has not yet
  acknowledged.
- **What a lost packet costs.** Nothing is resent on a timer. The next regular packet, 2, 4
  or 6 `net_main` calls later (1, 2 or 3 remote peers), carries the lost frames. Only the
  simulation tick waits; drawing and the local player's prediction go on. The tick can never
  run faster than real time afterwards, so each tick it waited becomes one more frame of
  input delay on that machine, and that delay is taken back one frame per 62 calls (or per
  31). See "When a packet is lost".
- Game messages (inventory, shop, dialog, level change, leave…) are byte strings queued by
  any code, attached to one of the sender's future input frames and executed by every
  machine, the sender included, when the simulation reaches that frame.
- There is no join in progress. The peer table is filled once, at the end of the launch
  handshake. Players leave by a game message, by a silence timeout that ends in a
  negotiated drop frame, or by a manual kick.

## How the pieces fit

Once per rendered frame `mainloop_runSession` (0x322998, call at 0x323248) calls
`net_main(0,0)` instead of `tasks_run`. One call does, in this order:

1. `net_pumpReceive` 0x13c078 — read every waiting datagram.
2. Housekeeping: kicked notices, silence timeout, kick negotiation (see "Drop").
3. Sample the local pad and camera yaw, apply the input lock, decide whether to *hold*
   (skip sampling this call), otherwise append `engine_frameStep()` (1 or 2) input records
   at `g_localInputFrame`.
4. Attach newly queued game-message bytes to an input frame.
5. Send an input packet to the peer whose turn it is in the send rotation.
6. Drop any peer whose agreed drop frame is the current frame.
7. Count how many consecutive frames from `g_netFrame` are *ready* (a record from every
   non-dropped peer); run `net_frameLoop(min(ready, engine_frameStep()))`.
8. `net_predictLocalPlayer` — run the ghost through local input frames not yet predicted.
9. Copy the raw local pad into `g_pads[local]` for menus and drawing.

`net_frameLoop` 0x139e88 runs one tick per step: apply each peer's record to its lockstep
pad, run that peer's game messages, run the run tasks, store the sync hash. After the last
step it may re-clone the ghost.

## Functions

| Address | Name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 0x131d88 | `net_predictLocalPlayer` | runs the ghost for input frames `g_simFrame … g_localInputFrame-1`; with no ghost it only updates the camera |

| 0x132e90 | `net_main` | (noSim, holdInput) the per-rendered-frame driver described above |
| 0x1345c0 | `net_debugLanLobby` | developer LAN discovery, only when flag 0x402792 is set |
| 0x134c60 | `net_launchTransfer` | prepares the launch: buffer, launch socket, own launch record (the handshake itself is 0x135638) |

| 0x1393f8 | `net_shutdown` | close socket, clear peer table, leave network mode |
| 0x1397a0 | `net_gameInit` | resets lockstep state and codec states, initialises libnet, reads own address |
| 0x139e88 | `net_frameLoop` | (steps) the simulation ticks |
| 0x13b5d0 | `net_frameLoop2` (name in names.tsv is wrong) | (packet, length, raw) receiver of input and raw-relay packets |
| 0x13c078 | `net_pumpReceive` | datagram dispatcher |
| 0x13c450 / 0x13c970 | `netcodec_encodeAxis` / `netcodec_decodeAxis` | stick channel codec |
| 0x13ce68 | `net_launchDraw` | launch screen |
| 0x13d668 | `net_localIsFirstActive` | host test |
| 0x13d760, 0x13e6b0 | static initialiser of the codec states and its table entry | |
| 0x13da90 | `ShockProjectile_clone` | not netcode |
| 0x13da98 / 0x13dc30 | `net_registerMsgHandler` / `net_registerDirectHandler` | |
| 0x13db38 | `net_sendGameMsg` | (id, bytes, length) queue a game message; offline it calls the handler at once (0x13db78) |
| 0x13dcd0, 0x13dce0 | `net_clearGhost`, `net_startSync` | |
| 0x13dd40 … 0x13e638 | small queries and setters | see the symbol file |
| 0x13e6d0, 0x13e8f8, 0x13eac8, 0x13ebd8 | script loader pieces | not netcode |

Two netcode functions sit just below the range, in the creatures area: `net_sendMsgToPeers`
0x131b00 (direct, unsynchronised packet to a peer mask) and `net_kickPeer` 0x131cb8.

## Data structures

### Peer — `g_peers` 0x5bf838, 4 entries of 0x44e0 bytes

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | u8[4] | IPv4 address in the byte order of the libnet address block (the developer lobby prints bytes 3, 2, 1, 0 as a.b.c.d) | copied into bytes 4–7 of the address block of every send, 0x139384 |

| +0x08 | 8 bytes | not referenced in the code read | Unknown |
| +0x10 | codec state, 0x4c | receive side: state after the newest frame received from this peer | 0x13b910–0x13bac8 |
| +0x5c | s32 | frame up to which the send-side codec state has been advanced | read 0x133888, written 0x134160 |
| +0x60 | codec state, 0x4c | send side: state just before the frame this peer last acknowledged | encode calls 0x133b98–0x133c88 |
| +0xac | 256 × 24 | input ring, index = frame & 0xff | 0x134324 (ready scan), 0x13be2c (store) |
| +0x18ac | 256 × 12 | sync ring {frame, sim-frame counter before the tick, hash}; the local peer's ring holds this machine's own hashes | 0x13af44–0x13b048, 0x13bec0 |
| +0x24ac | 0x2000 | game-message byte ring | written 0x13dbd0–0x13dc00 and 0x13c01c, read 0x13acb4–0x13ad24 |
| +0x44ac | u32 | message ring write position | 0x13dc14, 0x13c02c |
| +0x44b0 | u32 | message ring read position; written for remote peers only; no read found (displacement and absolute-address search) | 0x13ad54 |
| +0x44b4 | 2 × u32 | previous buttons and repeat counter for `pad_apply` on the lockstep pad | 0x13ac84 |
| +0x44bc | s32 | newest frame received from this peer | 0x13b7f4, 0x13be6c |
| +0x44c0 | s32 | newest of *our* frames this peer has acknowledged; set to 1 for all four at launch | 0x13b7c4, 0x13768c |
| +0x44c4 | s32 | peer's lead: its newest input frame minus its simulation frame | 0x13b7ac |
| +0x44c8 | s32 | peer's simulation frame as last reported | 0x13b790 |
| +0x44cc | s32 | `net_main` calls since the last accepted packet from this peer | 0x13b750, 0x133060 |
| +0x44d0 | s32 | heard flag, set on every accepted packet, cleared by `net_clearHeardFlags` | 0x13b75c |
| +0x44d4 | u8 | this entry is the local machine | 0x137638 |
| +0x44d5 | u8 | dropped: its input is no longer required or applied | 0x134278, 0x13dec0 |
| +0x44d6 | u8 | kick state: 0 none, 1 being negotiated, 2 negotiated | set to 1 in 0x133060–0x1330a8, at 0x131d40 and in 0x13c194–0x13c2a0; set to 2 at 0x133320 |
| +0x44d7 | u8 | out of sync | 0x13b0ac, 0x13bf30 |

`g_localSyncRing` 0x5c10e4 in names.tsv is simply peer 0's sync ring (0x5bf838 + 0x18ac);
the code always adds the local slot's offset to it.

### Input record — 24 bytes

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | u32 | frame number; the ready scan compares it with the frame wanted, so a stale ring entry is never used | 0x134340 |
| +0x04 | u16 | buttons: inverted pad bytes 2 and 3, byte 2 in the high half. *Inferred* from the usual libpad layout: 0x1 L2, 0x2 R2, 0x4 L1, 0x8 R1, 0x10 triangle, 0x20 circle, 0x40 cross, 0x80 square, 0x100 select, 0x200 L3, 0x400 R3, 0x800 start, 0x1000 up, 0x2000 right, 0x4000 down, 0x8000 left | sampler 0x17421c |
| +0x06, +0x07 | u8, u8 | stick pair that `pad_apply` turns into pad +0x14/+0x18 (movement); pad buffer bytes 6 and 7, the left stick in the usual layout | 0x174410 |
| +0x08, +0x09 | u8, u8 | stick pair for pad +0x1c/+0x20; pad buffer bytes 4 and 5 (right stick) | same |
| +0x0a, +0x0b | u8, u8 | pad buffer bytes 0x10 and 0x11 (L1 and R1 pressure). **Not transmitted** — see "Per-machine state" | 0x174410 writes pad +0x38 and +0x50 from them |
| +0x0c | u32 | sign-extended 16-bit camera yaw with bit 0 replaced by a flag (camera mode field +0x34 ≠ 1) | 0x133464–0x1334a8 |
| +0x10 | u32 | start of this frame's game-message bytes in the owner's message ring | 0x133740 |
| +0x14 | u32 | number of game-message bytes for this frame, 0 for none | 0x133754, read 0x13ac90 |

### Codec state — 0x4c bytes

Six copies exist: send and receive per peer (above), and four globals — `g_simEncState`
0x5bf798 / `g_simDecState` 0x5bf7e8 used by the tick for the local player, and
`g_predictEncState` 0x5bf6f8 / `g_predictDecState` 0x5bf748 used by prediction (copied from
the first pair at each ghost rebase, 0x13b340–0x13b4f8).

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | channel | record byte +0x08 |
| +0x10 | channel | record byte +0x09 |
| +0x20 | channel | record byte +0x06 |
| +0x30 | channel | record byte +0x07 |
| +0x40 | s16 | previous raw yaw (encoder only) |
| +0x42 | s16 | predicted yaw |
| +0x44 | s16 | current yaw delta per frame |
| +0x48 | s32 | count of frames coded; only ever incremented |

A channel is {s32 step index 0–8, s32 predictor 0–255, float smoothed value, float
velocity}. Reset state is index 0, predictor 0, smoothed 128.0, velocity 0.

### Packet types (first 32-bit word of a datagram)

| Word | Meaning | Sent from | Handled at |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0xbd3d, 0xbd3e | developer LAN lobby announce / start | 0x1345c0 | same |
| 0xbd3f | input packet | `net_main` 0x1341a8 | `net_frameLoop2`, called at 0x13c3d4 |
| 0xbd40 | marker of the sync record *inside* an input packet | 0x1391e4 | 0x13be68 |
| 0xbd41 | kick request {requester slot, mask of peers being kicked} | `net_main` 0x133234, every 30 rendered frames | 0x13c194–0x13c3a8 |
| 0xbd42 | raw relay of a kicked peer's last frames | 0x13c3a8 | `net_frameLoop2` with raw = 1 |
| 0xbd43 | "you were kicked" notice, 4 bytes | `net_main` 0x132fdc | sets flag 0x4027a0, shown by the HUD |
| 0xbd44–0xbd47 | direct messages, handler table 0x5d14e0 (only index 0 is registered: 0x31f308, 0x86-byte voice frames — *Inferred* from the Logitech audio library strings) | `net_sendMsgToPeers` 0x131b00 | 0x13c1b4 |

### Input packet (0xbd3f) and raw relay (0xbd42)

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u32 | type |
| 4 | u32 | last frame in the packet |
| 8 | u8 | low nibble: slot the frames belong to; high nibble: sender's *active mask* (bit per peer that is not dropped, not being kicked and not out of sync) |
| 9 | u8 | input packet: last frame − sender's simulation frame; raw relay: slot of the relaying machine |
| 10 | u8 | number of frames |
| 11 | s8 | acknowledgement: newest frame the sender has received from the addressee, minus the last frame of this packet |
| 12 | … | frames: bit stream (input packet) or 12-byte copies of record +4…+0xf (raw relay) |
| aligned to 4 | u32 | 0xbd40 followed by a 12-byte sync record, or 0xffffffff when this simulation frame's record was already sent (`g_netLastHashFrame` 0x4027cc) |
| then | repeated | message blocks {u8 last frame − frame, u8 byte count, bytes} for every frame in the packet that has message bytes, to the end of the datagram |

The first frame of an input packet is the frame the addressee last acknowledged (+0x44c0),
the last is `g_localInputFrame − 1`. The receiver (0x13b5d0):

1. Ignores the whole packet if the sender's active mask differs from its own (0x13b6ec), if
   the slot is local or dropped, if it is flagged out of sync, or if it is being kicked and
   the packet is not a raw relay.
2. Clears the silence counter, sets the heard flag, records the peer's simulation frame,
   lead and acknowledgement.
3. If the packet ends after the newest frame already held and starts no later than that
   frame + 1, decodes it, skipping frames already held (the skip count is passed to the
   decoder so that state is only advanced for new frames), and stores the new records with
   message count 0. A packet that starts later is discarded.
4. Stores the sync record in the peer's sync ring and compares it with this machine's own
   record for that frame if it has one (see "Sync check").
5. Copies each message block into the peer's message ring, once per frame (only while that
   record's count is still 0).

## The codec, bit by bit

The stream is an array of 16-bit words in the machine's byte order; fields are written most
significant bit first, bit position p lives in word p >> 4. A packet with n frames contains,
in this order:

1. **Buttons.** 16 bits: the first frame's button word. Then a list of 5-bit run lengths:
   a run says how many consecutive frames have the current word. After a run shorter than
   31, unless the frame count is exhausted, a 4-bit number names one bit to toggle; changing
   several bits at once costs a zero-length run per extra bit. A run of exactly 31 is
   followed directly by another run.
2. **Four stick channels**, in the order record +6, +7, +8, +9. Each sample is reduced to
   two bits by the adaptive delta coder: *move* (0 or 1) and *direction*. With step =
   table[index] (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 at 0x402860), move = 1 when the sample is
   at least one step away from the predictor; the predictor then moves by one step toward it
   (clamped 0–255); index += 2 after a move, −1 otherwise (clamped 0–8).
   Bits for a channel: the *move* bits first — alternating between a 5-bit count of zeros
   (31 means "31 zeros, another count follows"; anything less implies a following 1) and
   groups of five literal bits that repeat while a group contains a 1; then, only if any
   move bit was 1, one bit for the direction of the first move followed by 3-bit run
   lengths of moves with the same direction (7 means "seven, same direction continues").
3. **Yaw.** 5-bit run lengths of frames that keep the current delta (predicted = predicted +
   delta), each followed (unless 31 or the end) by one bit and either a new 9-bit signed
   delta (bit 1) or a 16-bit absolute value (bit 0). The encoder (inlined five times:
   0x13a378 in the tick, 0x132220 in prediction, 0x133ce0, 0x138448 and 0x138d28 for the
   wire) picks: absolute when the raw value jumped by more than 1000 or the prediction is
   off by more than 3000; otherwise delta = raw change, plus error/15 when the
   prediction is off by more than 200; the current delta is kept when the new one differs by
   less than 31 and has not changed sign; new deltas are clamped to ±255.
4. **Yaw flag** (bit 0 of record +0xc): one bit, then 5-bit run lengths, the bit toggling
   after every run shorter than 31.
5. 16 bits 0xa5a5. Nothing checks it.

The decoder (0x13c970) rebuilds the predictor and then runs ten steps of a spring toward it
in single-precision floats (velocity = (velocity + (target − value) × 0.05) × 0.5528, value
+= velocity); the truncated value is the stick byte. The local player's own input goes
through the same encode and decode before the tick uses it (G4), so all machines agree.

Consequences, from a re-implementation of the two functions (scratch model, not game code):

- A stick pushed from centre to full reads 129, 134, 143, 162, 201, 227, 239, 245 on the
  following frames: about half deflection after 4 frames and the 0.8 threshold `pad_apply`
  uses for digital directions after 6. This is in every net game regardless of connection,
  and the ghost is fed through the same codec. *Inferred* (model), not measured.
- With the reset state a centred stick decodes as 77, 43, 34, 44, 78, 101 … and only settles
  near 127 after about 13 frames. It is the same on every machine.

## The tick — `net_frameLoop(steps)` 0x139e88

For each step, unless a level name is pending in 0x41b6d0 (then the step does nothing and
`g_netFrame` does not advance, 0x139fb4):

1. Save `g_simFrame`, set it to `g_netFrame`.
2. For each peer in slot order that is not dropped: take its record for `g_netFrame`; for
   the local slot pass it through encode and decode (0x13a29c–0x13a99c); `pad_apply` it to
   `g_pads[slot]` (0x13ac84); store the low 16 bits of record +0xc in `g_netCamYaw[slot]`
   (0x13ac9c); then walk this frame's message bytes {id, length, payload} and call
   `g_netMsgHandlers[id](payload, length)` (0x13ad24).
3. For each peer that is being kicked and whose drop frame is this frame: clear object flag
   0x400000 on its player, call its take-damage slot with 1,000,000 and
   `Player_processDamage` (0x13ae48–0x13aeb8).
4. `tasks_run(1, 2)` with `g_inSimTick` set (0x13aee0).
5. Move the hit-flash flag 0x100 from the real local player to the ghost.
6. `path_service(1)`; `g_netFrame++`; restore `g_simFrame`.
7. Store the sync record for the new `g_netFrame`: hash = `g_randSeed` + `g_syncAcc` (never
   non-zero: its only writer stores 0, 0x139870) + integer x, y, height of every player
   object; compare with each remote peer's record for the same frame (0x13b048).

After the loop: the exclude mask goes back to 0x200000, and if more than 30 frames have
passed since the last rebase (or the force flag is set), a player object exists, the game
is not paused and the pause menu is not open, the ghost is deleted and cloned again from the
real player, `g_simFrame` is set to `g_netFrame` and the prediction codec states are
refreshed (0x13b1c8–0x13b5b0). `g_netAckFrame` 0x4027d4 is the frame of that last rebase;
despite its name nothing waits on it.

## Prediction — `net_predictLocalPlayer` 0x131d88

Outside the tick `g_simFrame` is the *prediction frame*. While it is below
`g_localInputFrame` the function takes the local record for that frame, runs it through the
prediction codec states, applies it to `g_pads[local]` and `g_netCamYaw[local]`, points the
player table at the ghost, runs the ghost's run slot, restores seed, hit points, mana and
the table pointer (G3), and increments `g_simFrame`. So each input frame is predicted once;
the ghost is only corrected at a rebase. The flag 0x4000000 on the ghost and
`g_predictCatchingUp` are set while more than one call's worth of frames remains, and the
camera is only updated when they are clear.

## Pacing and lag

### Input delay is not a constant

Input sampled in a call is stored at frame `g_localInputFrame` (0x4027a4), which then
advances by `engine_frameStep()`. The simulation may run at most up to
`g_localInputFrame − 2` in that call (0x1342bc), and at most `engine_frameStep()` frames per
call (0x1343a0–0x1343cc). The *lead* (`g_localInputFrame − g_netFrame`) is therefore at
least 2 and otherwise whatever it has grown to: it grows by one for every tick the
simulation could not run while input was still being sampled, and it shrinks only when a
call is *held* (no sample taken). A call is held when any of these is true (0x13354c–
0x133608):

| Rule | Condition | Constant at |
|---|---|---|
| cap | `g_localInputFrame` − (lowest simulation frame of this machine and all active peers) > 38 | 0x133554 |
| equalise | own lead ≥ 5 above the smallest lead (own and peers') for 31 calls in a row | 0x13354c, 0x133574 |
| trim | every 62nd call, if the smallest ready count seen in the window was > 2 | 0x1335c0, 0x1335e4, reset value 100 at 0x1335d8 |
| caller | second argument of `net_main` non-zero | 0x1335ac |
| (never) | `g_localInputFrame` < 3 | 0x133600 |

### What makes the loop wait

The ready scan (0x1342a8–0x134378) counts frames f = `g_netFrame`, `g_netFrame`+1 … below
`g_localInputFrame − 1` for which every non-dropped peer's ring entry carries frame number
f. The first missing record ends the count. If the count is 0 the call runs no tick and
`g_netStallCalls` 0x4027d0 goes up.

### How often packets go out

One input packet per peer per *send cycle*. `g_netSendCycle` = `g_netSendCycleTable`[number
of remote peers that are not dropped and not being kicked] = 2, 4 or 6 calls (table at
0x4027e8, read at 0x1337cc), times 1.5 when the UART modem driver is loaded (0x1337e0).
Peer k of n is served when the phase counter equals k × cycle / n (0x133850), so one packet
leaves every second call (third on the modem) whatever the player count. A packet is sent
even when it carries nothing new. It goes out through
`sceInetSendTo(0x5d1458, 0x5d0c40, socket 0x4027c8, buffer, length, 0, address block, port,
1000 ms)` at 0x1393b8. The receive side polls `sceInetRecvFrom(…, buffer, 0x7c0, &flags,
&address, &port, 0 ms)` at 0x13c14c until it returns −500.

Sync records ride inside input packets: at most one per simulation frame for the whole
machine (not per peer), never repeated. A lost one just means that frame is not compared.

### When a packet is lost

*Observed* mechanism, *Inferred* numbers (at 60 rendered frames per second):

- The frames it carried arrive with the next packet from that peer: 2 calls later with one
  remote peer (33 ms), 4 with two (67 ms), 6 with three (100 ms); 3, 6, 9 on the modem.
  Acknowledgements ride in the same packets, so a lost packet also delays the sender's
  knowledge of what was received, which only makes later packets a little longer.
- The receiving machine's tick stalls only if it uses up that peer's buffered frames before
  the next packet arrives, and then for at most one send interval per lost packet. How many
  frames are buffered depends on the relative timing of the machines: the pacing rules let
  the smaller of (own lead − 1) and (frames buffered from the slowest-arriving peer) settle
  at 2 or less, so at least one machine of a pair normally runs close to the edge.
- During the stall the machine keeps drawing, keeps sampling input and keeps predicting its
  own player, until its input is 38 frames ahead of the slowest simulation frame; then
  sampling stops too.
- The stall is not caught up: the tick runs at most `engine_frameStep()` frames per call,
  the same rate at which input is sampled. Every stalled tick therefore adds one frame to
  that machine's lead. The trim rule gives back one call's worth per 62 calls, the equalise
  rule one per 31 calls, and a held call on one machine can in turn stall a machine that was
  waiting for its input. After a long stall (anything over about 0.6 s reaches the cap) the
  lead is 38 frames and takes tens of seconds to drain.
- The same applies when one machine simply runs slowly: `engine_frameStep()` is capped at 2,
  so a machine rendering below 30 frames per second produces fewer than 60 input frames per
  second and every other machine stalls behind it.
- Long silences: after 300 stalled calls the HUD counter 0x40279c starts and the
  no-connection icon blinks; after 900 calls without an accepted packet from a peer the
  kick negotiation starts (below); the HUD shows the lost-connection text 1200 calls after
  the counter started and leaves the game at 1800 when more than two players were in it
  (thresholds in the HUD draw task 0x1dbc48, outside this range).

### Constants that control delay, pacing and timeouts

## Sync check

A record is {frame, value of `g_simFrame` before the tick (not compared), hash}. The
comparison is made twice, whichever side arrives second: when a record is received
(0x13bec0–0x13bf30) and when the local record is stored (0x13b048). A mismatch sets the
peer's out-of-sync byte and prints the "out of SYNC" line. From then on that peer's bit leaves this
machine's active mask and its packets are ignored, so the simulation stops as soon as that
peer's buffered input runs out; 900 calls later the silence timeout kicks it. In a
two-player game both sides flag each other and each ends alone. *Inferred* from the flag's
uses; not seen running.

## Game messages

`net_sendGameMsg(id, bytes, n)` appends {id, n, bytes} to the local peer's message ring.
`net_main` (0x1336c4–0x13375c) attaches everything queued since the last attach to one input
frame: the frame after the first one not yet sent to anybody, or `g_netFrame` if that is
later — and only when such a frame already exists, so messages wait for the next send turn.
The block travels with that frame in every packet until acknowledged and is executed in
step 2 of the tick on every machine. Offline the handler is called immediately.

Ids are handed out by `net_registerMsgHandler` in the order of seven calls at
0x323e50–0x323e80:

| Id | Id stored at | Handler | Registered by | Family |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0x83d1c8 | 0x198f64 | `cut_registerNetMsg` 0x19b4b4 | cutscene |
| 1 | 0x505b14 | 0x31f354 | 0x31fd38 (also registers direct handler 0x31f308) | voice |
| 2 | 0x8e2e94 | `dialog_onMsg` 0x22ee2c | 0x22f974 | NPC dialog |
| 3 | 0x86ac40 | `hud_onMsg` 0x1d8ca0 | `hud_registerMsgHandler` 0x1dc194 | game |
| 4 | 0x86aa60 | 0x1e01b0 (empty) | same | none |
| 5 | 0x866d18 | `invmsg_dispatch` 0x1bfdb0 | 0x1c59a8 | inventory |
| 6 | 0x8e8ed8 | 0x31d82c | 0x31da4c | text line |
| 7 | 0x86a6a0 | `shop_onMsg` 0x1c5d28 | 0x1d13a0 | shop |

The handlers are outside this range and were only skimmed; their owners' documents have the
detail. Payload byte 0 is a sub-type except where noted.

| Id / sub | Payload after the sub-type | Sender and occasion | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | none (length 0) | `cut_advance` 0x199214 when this machine's dialog audio has ended | counts "voice done" for the cutscene wait key (D18) |
| 1 | one byte: slot in the low nibble, bit 7 = on | 0x31f1a4 (on), 0x31f1e4 (off) | sets or clears the slot's bit in 0x503968; talk indicator, *Inferred* |
| 2 / 0 | name length, NPC name, padding, player slot, two bytes, camera position (3 words), two camera angles | `dialog_start` 0x22fa50 from script `startDialog` | closes menus, moves every machine's camera to the sender's, starts the dialog |
| 2 / 1, 2, 3, 4 | 2 has one signed byte | dialog task 0x22ff48 from the raw local pad and local audio state | confirm, move choice, end, leave request |
| 3 / 0 | slot, a, b | 0x1de06c, quick-cast selector | swaps record bytes +0x4a84/+0x4a85 |
| 3 / 1 | slot, b, 32-bit, 64-bit | 0x1de3ec | assigns a spell to an ability record |
| 3 / 2 | slot, state, flag | `hudmsg_sendMenuState` 0x1de0dc, 14 call sites, net games only | state 0: clears object flag 0x800000, masks buttons 0xf0 for 60 calls on the owner; else sets 0x400000 (and 0x800000 when state > 1) |
| 3 / 3 | slot | 0x1de138 | recall potion |
| 3 / 4 | slot | 0x1de16c, only from the machine for which `net_localIsFirstActive` is true, when a peer is dropped | shows the player-left text and kills that player's character |
| 3 / 5 | three filler bytes, then a 32-bit **object address** | 0x1de1a0 from `Savepoint_run` | stores 1 at address + 0xcc |
| 3 / 6 | slot | 0x1de1e0 from the HUD draw task while the local player is leaving | on the other machines: `net_disconnectPlayer(slot, 1)` |
| 3 / 7 | level name string | 0x1d9250 | writes the pending level name 0x41b6d0; the tick then stops |
| 3 / 8 | none | 0x1de25c | starts the mission-exit countdown |
| 3 / 9 | none | 0x1de430, host only | resets the checksum count |
| 3 / 10 | slot, two filler bytes, two 32-bit checksums | `net_sendChecksums` 0x1de46c | when all have arrived, a mismatch sets `g_checksumFailed` and drops that slot |
| 3 / 11 | three filler bytes, level name | 0x1de598 | like 7, also clears the pause-menu flag |
| 3 / 12 | none | 0x1de5ec from the medal scripts | sets 0x4f7140 |
| 3 / 13 | slot, a | 0x1de0a4 | quick-cast warning |
| 4 / 0, 1 | none; slot | 0x1e0108 (unreferenced), 0x1e0134 | nothing — the handler is empty |
| 5 / 0–10 | see `symbols/ui.tsv` (`invmsg_send*`) | inventory screens | drop, equip, unequip, join panel, weapon class, stat point, skill point, combine, level byte, use potion |
| 6 | no sub-type: the text-entry buffer at 0x8e8a40, which starts with its own length byte (length + 5 bytes are sent) | 0x31da74 | appends a line to an 8-line log at 0x8e8ac8; text chat, *Inferred* |
| 7 / 0 | slot, 2 filler bytes, 32-bit **address** of a stock record in the static table 0x866e78 | `shopmsg_sendBuy` 0x1c5f78 | `shop_buy` |
| 7 / 1 | slot, 16-bit, 32-bit index, 16-bit, bag, two bytes | 0x1d1330 | sell |

Limits: a message is at most 255 bytes (length byte); the bytes attached to one frame are
counted in one byte on the wire (0x1392c4–0x1392c8) although the ring field is 32 bits; the id is not
range-checked before the table call (0x13ad24).

## Launch, drop and disconnect

### Launch

`frontend_startNetGame` 0x1e21e0 calls `net_gameInit` and `net_launchTransfer`; the
front-end task then calls `net_launchUpdate` every frame while flag 0x402793 is set
(call at 0x1e0af4). The handshake runs on its own socket (`g_launchSocket`) with packets
{sender's player id, type, argument, payload}, mostly 0x200 bytes long:

| Type | Name in the executable's status strings | Argument / payload |
|---|---|---|
| 0, 1 | SHAKE, SHAKE ACK | the sender's 0xd0-byte info block (name, appearance, level, data size, game options, button configuration, chunk size) |
| 2, 3 | SIZE, SIZE ACK | byte count of the character data to follow |
| 4, 5 | DATA, DATA ACK | (16-bit checksum << 16) \| sequence; payload = chunk |
| 6, 7 | KEEP ALIVE, KEEP ALIVE ACK | 7 carries the number of other players the sender sees as ready |
| 8 | HOST FORCE LAUNCH | bit mask of players to keep |

Per remote player there is a 0x144-byte record in `g_launchRecs` with a state byte at +0x5c:
0 contacting, 1 or 5 contacted (who sends first depends on index order), 2 size sent, 3
sending a chunk, 4 waiting for its acknowledgement, 6 receiving, 7 then 8 done. Known
fields: +0x10 address block, +0x38 port, +0x3c bytes left, +0x40 player id, +0x48 last DATA
word, +0x4c last chunk size, +0x50 unanswered count, +0x58 time of last change, +0x5d flag
bits, +0x60 transfer cursor, +0x64 contacted, +0x68 info block, +0x138 sequence, +0x13c /
+0x140 bytes done / total. The rest of the record was not mapped.

If a packet arrives from this machine's own external address the peer is re-addressed to its
internal address and port 4000 (two consoles behind one router, 0x135974–0x1359f4). What is
transferred is each player's character: the full 0x4c30-byte player structure or a 0x2c-byte
summary, depending on mode bits in 0x402a30.

When every other player is in state 8 and has confirmed, a 120-frame countdown runs and the
function finishes (0x136ffc onward): closes the launch socket, compacts the player list to
the kept mask, installs every player's button configuration into the per-slot tables
0x41b980…0x41ba30, sets difficulty and versus flags, clears the save buffer, writes address,
port and local flag of each peer, sets `g_numPeers`, sets +0x44c0 = 1 for all peers, and
opens the game socket on this machine's port. The front end then sets `g_networkMode`,
calls `game_resetState` and `net_startSync`, which zeroes the shared seed. The host can
force a launch with only the ready players (button 0x40 and a confirmation), any player can
cancel (button 0x20). A launch with somebody uncontacted for 2700 frames fails.

There is no code that adds a peer after this point (*Observed*: `g_numPeers` is written
only by the launch, the developer lobby and shutdown).

### Level change

Message 3/7 or 3/11 sets the pending level name on every machine in the same tick; ticks
then do nothing. The main loop calls `net_flushBeforeLoad`, loads, calls `net_main(1,0)`,
`net_clearHeardFlags`, and then `net_main(1,1)` once per rendered frame until
`net_allPeersHeard` or the stall counter limit. The silence counters keep running during
that wait, so a machine that loads more than about 900 rendered frames slower than another
is kicked by it. *Inferred* from the counters; not seen.

### Drop

- **Leaving on purpose.** The leaving machine sends 3/6 every frame of its exit countdown
  and then turns network mode off. The others mark it dropped in the tick that carries the
  first of those messages.
- **Silence.** A remote peer's counter +0x44cc passes 900: kick state 1, drop frame −1,
  negotiation state 0x5d1450 = 1 (0x133060–0x1330a8).
- **Manual kick.** `net_kickPeer` 0x131cb8 does the same and also starts the kicked notice.
- **Negotiation.** While state 1, every 30 rendered frames a kick request goes to every
  active peer that has not answered. A machine receiving a request marks the named peers as
  being kicked too and answers with a raw relay of each named peer's last 41 frames. A raw
  relay both fills in frames the requester was missing and counts as the answer. When all
  have answered, the drop frame of every kicked peer becomes newest received frame + 1 and
  the state goes to 2, then 0 (0x133278–0x133340).
- **Execution.** When `g_netFrame` equals the drop frame the peer is marked dropped
  (0x13420c–0x134298) and, in that tick, its character is killed. The first active machine
  also sends 3/4.
- `net_fewerThanTwoActive`, `net_endIfAlone`, `net_dropAllRemotes` handle being the last
  one left.

## Per-machine state

Places in this range where shared state is, or could be, influenced by something that
differs between machines.

| # | What | Kind | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **L1/R1 pressure bytes are not on the wire.** A received record's bytes +0xa/+0xb are whatever was on the receiver's stack (the decoder writes only buttons, four sticks and yaw into the 12-byte scratch records, which are then copied whole into the ring); the owner's own record keeps the real pad bytes. `pad_apply` turns them into lockstep pad +0x38 and +0x50, which therefore differ between machines. | Observed | store 0x13be2c–0x13be34; local path 0x13a29c–0x13ac84; `pad_apply` 0x174410 |
| 1a | The only reader of those two pad fields found, 0x174d80, returns 0 or 1 from the button bits in a net game, so today this does not reach the simulation. No exhaustive search for other readers was made. | Inferred harmless | 0x174d80 |
| 2 | **The active mask gates all input.** A packet is discarded unless the sender's set of "not dropped, not kicked, not out of sync" peers equals the receiver's. Dropped and out-of-sync bytes change at a simulation frame or on receipt of a hash, i.e. at different real times on different machines. If machine A passes the frame that drops a third player before machine B has received A's input for that frame, B can never accept it afterwards and both wait until the 900-call timeout kicks the other. Needs own lead ≥ send cycle to be safe; three- and four-player games only. | Observed rule, Inferred consequence | 0x13b6ec; `net_disconnectPlayer` 0x13de68; flags 0x13b0ac, 0x13bf30 |
| 3 | **Raw local pad edges inside the tick.** `net_frameLoop` leaves the pressed-edge words of all four raw pads (`g_rawPads` +0xc, +0x10) live for the first tick of a call, zeroes them for later ticks and restores them at the end. Run tasks that read the raw pads therefore act on a frame that depends on this machine's timing; what they do must go through a game message. | Observed | save 0x139f3c, clear 0x13b140, restore 0x13b184 |
| 4 | **Message handlers run between pad updates.** Peer i's messages are executed before the pads and yaw of peers above i are set for the frame. At that moment the local slot's lockstep pad still holds the raw local pad (copied at the end of `net_main`) and `g_netCamYaw[local]` the predicted yaw; other machines see last frame's lockstep values there. A handler that reads another slot's pad or yaw would diverge. None was identified; handlers were not audited for it. | Observed order, Unknown impact | 0x13ac84 → 0x13ad24; 0x134454; 0x132b5c, 0x132b80 |
| 5 | `g_simFrame` (0x44fdcc) outside the tick is the prediction frame, which runs ahead of `g_netFrame` by this machine's lead. Draw-phase code that uses it to change shared state is per machine (compare D12). | Observed | 0x13af98, 0x13b28c, 0x132c94 |
| 6 | `net_objOrGhost` 0x13e180 returns the ghost on its owner's machine and the real player elsewhere. 17 call sites in simulation code (two in `Creature_run`, one at 0x1e4c1c, fourteen in skill code). Read: the two in `Creature_run` (0x113284, 0x113550) gate particle emitters that only write the cosmetic seed; 0x2c88e4 and 0x2c8fe0 mirror a field write (+0x58c) onto the ghost; 0x2dee18, 0x2e1144 and 0x2e1214 take a position from the result while the same function draws from the spell's own generator. Not classified: 0x1e4c1c (fills a list of player objects), 0x2d1b04, 0x2e7cf8, 0x2e95cc, 0x2fb4c8, 0x2feed8, 0x2ffbd0, 0x302650, 0x303454, 0x3036e4. | Observed accessor, call sites partly checked | 0x13e180 |
| 7 | Ghost rebase between ticks: deletes and clones an object, restoring only the shared seed; sets flag 0x200000 on the real local player and moves flag 0x100 to the ghost, so the real player's flag word differs per machine (G1, D13). | Observed | 0x13b1c8–0x13b5b0, 0x13af18–0x13af34 |
| 8 | The drop frame of a silent peer comes from per-machine counters and is made equal by the raw-relay exchange. It works if no machine is more than 40 frames behind another in what it holds from the kicked peer; the 38-frame input cap is what keeps that true. | Inferred consistent | 0x133060, 0x13c370, 0x133554 |
| 9 | Message bytes per frame are counted in one byte on the wire. More than 255 bytes queued by one machine between two send turns would be executed in full locally and mis-parsed remotely. | Observed encoding, Inferred risk (needs e.g. two long text lines at once) | count byte 0x1392c4–0x1392c8, copy loop 0x139300–0x139304 |
| 10 | Message 3/5 carries a heap object address; it is only right on other machines if their heaps match. The ghost is a per-machine allocation. (Message 7/0 carries an address inside a static table, which is the same everywhere.) | Observed, impact Unknown | senders 0x1de1a0, 0x1c5f78 (outside the range) |
| 11 | The decoded stick byte depends on single-precision arithmetic and truncation. Identical on identical hardware; emulator instances with different floating-point settings could disagree in the input itself. | Inferred | 0x13cdb0–0x13cddc |
| 12 | Game messages are sent from draw tasks and from local conditions (pad, menus, audio position). That is the intended funnel, but the frame they land on is per machine, and `net_sendGameMsg` acts at once offline and `lead` frames later online. | Observed | 0x13db78 |
| 13 | `g_inSimTick` is set only around step 3 and 4 of the tick, not while message handlers run. | Observed | 0x13ae30, 0x13af40 |
| 14 | The sync hash covers the shared seed and player positions only, and a lost sync record is not resent, so other divergence is reported late or never. | Observed | 0x13af44–0x13b048 |

The input lock (`net_lockLocalInput`, `net_maskLocalButtons`) is applied only on the machine
that owns the slot and before the sample becomes a record, so it is not a hazard even though
it is timed in calls.

## Corrections to earlier notes

- names.tsv `net_frameLoop2` 0x13b5d0 is the packet receiver, not a loop.
- names.tsv `g_netGameConn` 0x86ac40 is the game-message id 3, and the first argument of
  `net_sendGameMsg` is a message id, not a connection.
- names.tsv `g_netAckFrame` 0x4027d4 is the frame of the last ghost rebase; the tick does
  not stall on it.
- names.tsv `g_syncAcc` 0x4027c0 is always 0.
- names.tsv `net_launchTransfer` 0x134c60 only prepares; the SHAKE/SIZE/DATA exchange is in
  0x135638.
- FINDINGS L1 and L3: gameplay traffic is the game's own datagrams, see Summary. The answer
  to L3 is no.

## Open questions

- Whether the mask deadlock (row 2) happens in practice. Test: three machines, one leaves
  from the menu while the others are in a busy scene; watch for both remaining machines
  freezing and dropping each other about 15 s later.
- The lag figures: measure lead (`g_localInputFrame − g_netFrame`) over time on two
  machines after dropping packets for 0.1 s, 0.5 s and 2 s.
- Whether any simulation code besides 0x174d80 reads lockstep pad +0x38 or +0x50.
- The ten call sites of `net_objOrGhost` listed as not classified, and whether the number
  of generator draws in 0x2dedec and 0x2e0d10 can depend on the ghost's position.
- Whether heap addresses agree between machines when message 3/5 is sent.
- Peer bytes +0x08…+0x0f; the unmapped parts of the launch record; the exact meaning of the
  mode bits in 0x402a30 (set by lobby code).
- `scr_findInTable38`: what the table at script header +0x38 holds.

Not done: `net_launchUpdate` and `net_launchDraw` were read for structure, not line by
line; the message handlers outside the range were skimmed only; `net_loadModules` was read
only far enough to name it.

# Monsters and level objects (0x232000–0x2c3cd4)

885 functions, 148 virtual tables: 73 creature classes (monsters, bosses, a few creature-shaped
helpers such as `Generator`, `Teleporter`, `CreatureContainer`, `AntWave`) and 75 plain
`GameObject` classes (chests, containers, doors, switches, save points, jump gates, lights,
traps, monster projectiles). Everything here was read from the executable; nothing was run.

Claims are marked **Observed** (read at the address given), **Inferred** or **Unknown**.
Where a paragraph gives an address and no mark, it is Observed.

How this document was made: the catalogue tables, the per-state call summaries and the
per-machine scan were produced by scripts over `vtables`, the object factory and the
decompiles; the bosses named in the task, the Drundar arena classes and the level objects
that carry game rules were then read by hand. "What was not done" is at the end.

## 1. How the pieces fit

### 1.1 Where objects come from

- The object factory is the 15,668-byte function at 0x159c94 (objects area). It compares the
  type name from the level file against a chain of strings (`libc_strcasecmp`, or the prefix
  test at 0x159c20, shown below as `Name*`), calls `pool_new(size)` and then the class
  constructor. The "factory type names" and sizes in the catalogue come from that chain.
  Observed for the names checked by hand (Horsemen, Cazic, Skelight, Savepoint, JumpGate,
  Container, Chest); the rest were attributed by a branch-following script and a few may be
  attached to the wrong neighbour.
- A constructor calls the base constructor (`GameObject_ctor` 0x14cb10, or the creature
  constructor `Creature_ctor` (0x109d68)), stores its virtual table at +0x48, sets class fields, and puts
  the object on a run list: `obj_runEveryFrame` (0x14f248) (run every frame) or `obj_runEvery60` (0x14f2b8) (staggered lists).
  `obj_stopRunning` (0x14f290) takes an object off its run list and `obj_delete` (0x14f200) queues it for deletion.
- Monsters created at run time come from three places in this area: `Generator_run`
  (0x265938), `ScriptGenerator_spawn` (0x265fc4) and individual AI states (see the
  "Creates" column). All three go through the factory entry `world_createObject` (0x14f6c8) or call a constructor
  directly, always from run code.

### 1.2 Virtual slots used in this area

Slot numbers are `tools/vtab.py` numbers (slot n is at table offset n×8).

| Slot | Meaning | Kind | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | destructor (most are outside this range, in 0x3c3000–0x3cd000) | Observed | called with argument 3 to delete itself, e.g. at the end of Container_run 0x290e78 |
| 2 | take damage | given | overrides are thin wrappers around the creature version 0x116638 |
| 3 | receive a signal / start (value) | Observed for Timer 0x28ec7c and Counter 0x28eda4 | other classes' slot 3 not read; named `Class_vslot3` |
| 4 | run | given | |
| 5 | draw | given | |
| 6 | touched by another object | given | |
| 8 | load saved state from a buffer, returns bytes read | Observed | Savepoint 0x28dcd0, JumpGate 0x27d998 |
| 9 | save state to a buffer, returns bytes written | Observed | Savepoint 0x28dc9c (6 bytes), JumpGate 0x27d974 (2 bytes), Skeleton 0x2a7508 (calls the creature version 0x116780 first, then adds 12 bytes) |
| 11 | creature only: called with a zero-terminated list of touched objects | Observed for Cazic 0x24c04c only | |
| 13 / 14 | interact prompt / interact | given | Chest 0x29297c / 0x292a2c, Savepoint 0x28da58 / 0x28dc30, Lever 0x28e4c0 / 0x28e60c |
| 16 | creature: returns the model handle used for drawing and effects | Inferred | result is passed where other classes pass `*(+0x24)+0xc` (compare Cazic_run 0x24aaf0 head with Horsemen_run 0x27236c head) |
| 17–19 | AutoProp family only | Unknown | named `_vslot17..19` |
| 20 | "is this object my enemy" | given | 4 overrides here |
| 23 / 25 / 26 / 28 | creature base helpers called from every run function with small integer arguments (offsets 0xbc, 0xcc, 0xd4, 0xe4) | Unknown | not overridden in this area |
| 27 | **set AI state** (new state) | Observed | every run function ends by calling it with the next state; overridden by 71 of 73 creature classes; each override starts with the common filter `Creature_filterState` (0x10a9c0), picks the animation for the state and stores the state at +0x232 |
| 35 | creature: returns the level value handed to a skill when the monster casts it | Inferred | its result is always the first argument of the skill's cast call (Horsemen_run state 0x17, Cazic_run states 7, 0xc, 0xd) |
| 38 | creature: second model argument for `Creature_draw` | Inferred | Cazic_draw 0x24aa6c |

A skill is called through its own table at skill+0x60: offset 0x0c answers "can this caster
use it now" (one argument, the caster), offset 0x14 casts (level, caster, position, facing)
and returns the spell object, which the caller sometimes links with `creature_addSpell`.
Offsets 0x44, 0x5c and 0x64 are parameter queries; 0x5c is the one monsters use to add an
elemental rider to a melee hit. Observed at the call sites listed in section 6; the
meaning of 0x44 and 0x64 is Unknown.

### 1.3 Shape of a monster run function

Observed in every one of the 14 run functions read by hand; the script found the same call
set in 68–72 of the 73.

1. optional: update the embedded weapon helper through its own table (object at +0x50);
2. `Creature_processDamage` (0x110d30) with (this, model) — creature damage reaction (creatures area);
3. `Creature_run(this, model)`; a non-zero result ends the function;
4. `Creature_updateActive(this)`; several classes return when it says "inactive";
5. `Creature_stepAnim` (0x1162b0) with (speed, this) advances the animation and returns a bit mask of animation
   events for this frame (bit 0 is "the hit frame" in every attack state read; bits 1–3 are
   further event markers; 0x80 is "animation ended" in the death handler `Creature_deadUpdate` (0x1108a0));
6. `Creature_applyKnockback` (0x115eb8) with (x, this) and the base call at table offset 0xbc;
7. `switch (state at +0x232)`, then one call to slot 27 with the next state.

Helpers that appear in almost every state (all in the creatures area; the names are the
creatures symbol file's, the descriptions are what the monster code relies on):

| Address | What the monster code uses it for | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `Creature_canSeeTargetIn` (0x118d40) | "is my target between these two distances, inside this arc" | reads the target handle +0x234, forwards to `creature_canSeeObj` (0x10c810) |
| `creature_findEnemyInCone` (0x10cf78) | find an enemy in range/arc, returns the object | result dereferenced as an object in Cazic_run states 10–0xc |
| `Creature_moveToTarget` (0x1143e8) | chase the target (path move) | used alone in the chase state of every class |
| `Creature_moveToDest` (0x119f38) | walk to the wander point +0x104, pick a new one when stuck | body read |
| `Creature_isAwayFromHome` (0x10eed8) | "am I outside my leash" (home +0x3b4, radius +0x3c0) | body read |
| `Creature_turnToTarget` (0x1187e0) | turn toward the target (calls table offset 0xd4) | body read |
| `Creature_hitAllEnemiesInArc` (0x119b58) / `Creature_hitTargetInArc` (0x119938) | melee hit test in an arc with damage min/max/type from +0xd0/+0xd2/+0xd4 and a flag word; non-zero when something was hit | called on the hit-frame event bit |
| `Creature_isNotRooted` (0x1195e0) / `Creature_isAttackReady` (0x1195f0) / `Creature_isNotStunned` (0x119608) | test timers +0x314 / +0x318 / +0x31c for zero | bodies read |
| `Creature_deadUpdate` (0x1108a0) | dead-body handler: blood decal, then sink into the ground and delete when creature flag 0x1000000 is set | body read |
| `Creature_dropLoot` (0x10f2c8) | called once on entering state 0x14 (death); not read here | setState case 0x14 of Cazic and Horsemen |
| `model_getAttachPoint` (0x1754a0) | world position of a model bone / attachment point | used before every projectile or effect spawn |

### 1.4 AI state numbers

State numbers are per class, but these are shared. **Observed**: the transitions; the
English names are **Inferred** from them.

| State | Behaviour seen | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | idle; look for a target (base call at offset 0xcc); leave to 3 with a target, to 1 when outside the leash | Cazic 0x24aaf0, Horsemen 0x27236c, Skelight 0x2a8b84 |
| 1 | walk back / wander (0x119f38) | same |
| 3 | chase; chooses an attack state when in range | same |
| 5 | between attacks: waits for timer A (+0x314), chooses the next attack | same |
| 6 … 0xf, 0x15 … | class-specific attacks and casts | see catalogue and section 4 |
| 0x10 | forced while timer B (+0x318) runs; moves through `Creature_fleeFromTarget` (0x119f08) → `Creature_fleeFrom` (0x115910) away from the target | filter `Creature_filterState` (0x10a9c0); Cazic setState case 0x10 sets the timer to 60 |
| 0x12 | wait until animation flag 0x10 clears (hit reaction) | Cazic, Horsemen |
| 0x13 | forced while timer C (+0x31c) runs (held / stunned) | filter `Creature_filterState` (0x10a9c0) |
| 0x14 | **dead**: the run function only calls the dead-body handler `Creature_deadUpdate` (0x1108a0); setState 0x14 calls `Creature_dropLoot` (0x10f2c8) and class death effects | Cazic_setState 0x24c118 case 0x14, Skelight_setState 0x2a91b8 |
| 0x17 | usually "rise / appear" (skeletons rising from the ground, bosses' entrance) | Skelight ctor 0x2a8770 enters it; ScriptGenerator_spawn puts Skeletons in it |

The filter `Creature_filterState` (0x10a9c0) runs at the top of every setState override. It returns without a
change when a PvP condition holds or when +0x231 is set and the request is state 1; it
redirects requests to 5, 0x13 or 0x10 while timers A, C or B are running; a request for
0x14 clears all four timers; a result of 0 also clears the target handle +0x234.

Earlier project notes describe state 0x14 as "cutscene actor". In every class read here it
is the death state; a defeated boss that then speaks in a cutscene is in it because he is
dead. (Affects the wording of FINDINGS D19, not its conclusion.)

## 2. Data structures

### 2.3 Globals owned by this area

| Address | Meaning | How |
|---|---|---|
| 0x500ae8 | jump-gate travel state: 0 idle, 1 when a destination is confirmed, then counts frames to 180 | 0x27dd74 |
| 0x8e3a3a, 0x8e3a3b | menu state 0–7; index of the player whose pad drives the menu | 0x27dd74, 0x27da24 |
| 0x8e3a50, 0x8e3c30 | destination names (0x20 bytes each) and their count | 0x27db60, 0x27dcf4 |
| 0x8e3c34, 0x8e3c38 | destination parameter of the opening gate; "gate was not drawn" flag | 0x27da24 |
| 0x8e3938 | scratch Vec3 holding the active gate's effect position | 0x27cb58 |

Other globals this area reads a lot: 0x44fdcc (`g_simFrame`) is the frame counter (equal to the lockstep
frame inside a simulated tick, see `net_frameLoop`); 0x4f714c is a float "monster level"
used to scale trap, explosion and summon strength (written by `arena_startWave` (0x305ed4); temporarily
replaced inside the Skelight constructor and 0x245568); 0x4dcec8 + i×0x4c30 is player i's
object pointer; 0x44fe18 and 0x41b721 hold the current level name.

**0x404468 is a fourth random generator** (same constants as the other three). In the whole
program it is used by seven functions: the creature damage reaction `Creature_processDamage` (0x110d30) (blood),
`Player_run` (which of four swing sounds; the branch at 0x1aa8ac runs for non-local players
and for the prediction copy), Cazic_deathEffects 0x24c994, Marr's death effects 0x284b68 and
three skill functions. Every use read here chooses a sound or scatters particles, so it is
a second cosmetic generator; it differs between machines by construction. Observed for the
four functions named; the three skill functions (0x2c7808, 0x2ee068, 0x308578) were not read.

## 3. Catalogue

Generated from the virtual tables and the factory. `base` means the class uses the
inherited function (for TakeDamage: `Creature` 0x116638 or the empty `GameObject` one).
"AI states" is the set of `case` labels in the run function's switch on +0x232 — states the
class names explicitly, not necessarily ones it can reach. "Skills referenced" and
"Creates" come from the class's own functions and private helpers; "Creates" lists classes
whose constructor is called directly (objects made through the factory by name do not
show). Sizes are the `pool_new` argument at the factory call; `?` means the class is only
created by other code. All **Observed** by script; rows for the classes in sections 4 and
5 were also checked by hand.

## 4. Bosses

Unless a state is described in a sentence, the entry is the script's summary of which
helpers that state calls (**Observed** call sites, not a full reading of every branch).
"Rider" means the monster asks a weapon-enchant skill for a number (table offset 0x5c) and
attaches it to the melee hit as an elemental effect.

### Horsemen (the four knights) — read in full

Constructor 0x271c70, run 0x27236c, draw 0x2721f8, setState 0x272f4c. One class, four
variants (+0x470). `UndeadKnight1–4` are created without a mount; `Rider*` get a Nightmare
(constructor 0x270968) linked both ways through +0x3c8 and start in state 0x1b.

- Unmounted: the normal run skeleton, then the state switch. Mounted: the rider copies the
  mount's position and facing every frame, re-links itself in the world grid (0x14f028),
  and takes over the mount's target (0x2723c4–0x272490).
- State 3 (chase): target within 36 units → 5; a second 36-unit test with a 6000 arc and
  `Creature_isTargetCharging` (0x118f90) true → 8; target within 400 units and `Creature_countAlliesNearTarget` (0x119258) (36 units) positive → 5. Then
  the skill: variants 0–2, once `age > +0x474`, go to state 0x17 when an enemy is within
  400 units in a 6000 arc; **variant 3 goes to 0x17 whenever SummonSkeleton's "can cast"
  test passes, without looking at +0x474** (0x2726a0–0x27271c). Otherwise keep chasing.
- State 5: while timer A runs, a target within 36 units → 6. With timer A clear and the target within 36 units, two draws from the knight's
  own generator choose between states 10, 7 and 6; with the target within 72 units in a
  narrow arc → 0xb; otherwise one own-generator draw in 60 per frame returns to chase.
- States 6, 7, 10, 0xb: melee swing; on the hit event a full-damage arc test (flag 8 plus
  the weapon helper's value), on event bit 1 a second test with a third of the damage.
  State 8: single heavy swing (flags 0x40008).
- **State 0x17 (cast)** on the hit event: variant 0 casts skill 4 DiseaseBolt from chest
  height; variant 1 casts skill 7 FireStorm at the target's position; variant 2 casts
  skill 87 TagarsInsects on itself and links the spell; variant 3 casts skill 11
  SummonSkeleton at its own position. Then `+0x474 = age + 480 + own random mod 120`.
- States 0x1f–0x22 are the mounted swings (arc turned 90° to the side); 0x1a counts +0x472
  down; 0x23 is an animation hand-over; 0x14 dead.
- All randomness is the knight's own generator. No global, camera, pad, audio or timer
  read in run, setState or draw. Draw calls `Creature_draw` and then the weapon helper's
  draw (table offset 0x94), neither in this area.

### Cazic — read in full; the run function is 0x24aaf0

Constructor 0x24a670, run **0x24aaf0**, draw 0x24aa6c, setState 0x24c118, slot 11 0x24c04c,
helpers 0x24c564, 0x24c5a4, 0x24c7fc, 0x24c994. The function at 0x248598 that earlier notes
call Cazic's run belongs to `Bubo` (type `Bubonian*`, table 0x513fe0); Cazic's table
0x514128 has 0x24aaf0 in slot 4 (**Observed**: table words, and the constructor stores
0x514128 at +0x48).

Two variants. The constructor compares the type name with `cazicavatar`: the avatar gets
`+0x3c9 = 1`, radius 25 and scale 0.7; `cazicthule` gets `+0x3c9 = 0` and loads an extra
lump. `Cazic_isNonAvatarAboveHalfHp` (0x24c564) returns 1 only for the non-avatar variant
with more than half its hit points; every casting branch is behind it.

- Every frame: byte +0xa0 is 6 while that test is true and no cutscene is active, else 0.
- State 3 (chase): target within 48 units → 5. If the test is false and `+0x3cc < age` and
  the target is 144–360 units away → 0xf (charge). If the test is true: SummonSkeleton
  "can cast" → 0xd; an enemy within 360 → 5; an enemy within 60 → 5.
- State 5: target not within 60 units — test true and SummonSkeleton castable → 0xd; test
  true and an enemy within 360: 0xc when +0x3c8 ≥ 5, else state 10 or 0xb by one own
  draw; test true otherwise: 0xd when +0x3c8 ≥ 5; in all other cases wait for timer A and
  return to 3. Target within 60 units — by angle to the target: in front → 0xe (combo) or,
  when +0x3c8 ≥ 5, 7 (ground pound); to either side → 8 or 9.
- State 6, 8, 9, 0xe: melee arcs; each hit increments +0x3c8.
- State 7: on the hit event creates a 0x9c-byte ground-pound object 60 units ahead through
  `GroundPoundEffect_ctor` (0x2c74ac) with skill 38 (GroundPound) and the slot-35 level, then a 60-unit melee test;
  resets +0x3c8.
- States 10 / 0xb: `Cazic_castShockOfFire` (0x24c5a4, builds a `Sparks` object) when the
  enemy is within 200 units, else `Cazic_castShockOfFrost` (0x24c7fc).
- State 0xc: the same pair on earlier event bits, and on event mask 8 casts skill 7
  FireStorm (enemy within 200) or skill 58 FrostStorm.
- State 0xd: when SummonSkeleton is castable, casts skill 11 twice, 60 units to the left
  and right; otherwise casts skill 96 FrostArmor on himself if he has no spell of type
  `SpellFrostArmor_typeinfo` (0x3d1d70), else skill 95 WaveOfFlame; the result is linked as his spell.
- State 0xf: charge; slot 11 (0x24c04c) damages every player he touches and goes to 5;
  when the animation ends `+0x3cc = age + 300`.
- State 0x14 (setState): creature flag 0x20000000000, the common death call `Creature_dropLoot` (0x10f2c8), then
  every creature named `skelightm` (up to 10, found with `world_findObjectsByName` (0x14bf58)) is sent to state 0x14,
  and the base call at offset 0xe4 runs. The run-side of 0x14 calls the dead-body handler
  and, for the non-avatar only, `Cazic_deathEffects`.

**Consequence (Inferred from the above):** the avatar (+0x3c9 = 1) can reach only states
0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0xe, 0xf and the common ones. It never casts FireStorm, FrostStorm
or SummonSkeleton; its only skill object is the ground pound. In the arena the summoned
skeletons therefore come from knight variant 3 alone. This contradicts the note on
`Cazic_ctor` in `names.tsv` and FINDINGS D3's reading of who casts what; it holds only if
the arena object's type really is `cazicavatar` (taken from `names.tsv`, not re-checked in
the level file).

### Skelight (the summoned skeleton)

Constructor 0x2a8770 (called by the factory for type `Skelight` and by the SummonSkeleton
skill at 0x2e2040), run 0x2a8b84, setState 0x2a91b8. The constructor temporarily writes its
level argument into the monster-level global 0x4f714c, calls the stat scaler `Creature_setStats` (0x10a620) (one
argument differs when the current level name is `blomedal`), restores the global, and
enters state 0x17. State 0x17 calls `fx_spawn(7, position)` every frame until the rise
animation ends. State 3 chases; 6 is the only attack (48-unit arc, flag 8, +0xf4 counts the
swing down). setState 0x14 clears the static 0x8e4560, spawns an effect and queues the
object for deletion. No per-machine read in run, setState or draw.

`fx_spawn` (0x1ef270, gameplay area) returns early when the position is not near the local
camera, except for effect type 5 — the only type that draws from the shared generator and
creates objects (**Observed**: test at 0x1ef2e0; shared-generator use only in case 5). Type
7 is particles from the cosmetic generator.

### Skeleton and UndeadKnight

- Skeleton (0x2a5af4 / run 0x2a6864): state 8 is the archer shot — references skills 43,
  44, 47 and creates FireArrow, ColdArrow, ExplodeArrow or plain projectiles with four own
  draws; 0x17 rises from the ground with `fx_spawn`. Constructor is also called from
  0x2bfe2c (a Wraith helper).
- UndeadKnight (0x2b3e30 / run 0x2b4370): states 7–0xb are melee swings chosen in state 3
  with three own draws; 0x17 emits particles. Its draw function has a latent bug, see 7.

### Zek (`raloszek`)

Run 0x2c2440 (already named), takeDamage 0x2c34e4 (840 bytes, not read), setState
0x2c382c. States 6–0xc: melee arcs. State 0xd: creates a `GroundPoundEffect` with
skill 38. State 0xe: finds an enemy and links a handle. The function tail creates
`LightEffect` objects and plays sounds on animation events.

### Innoruuk

Constructor 0x2735dc, run 0x273bd0 (11,760 bytes), takeDamage 0x276a58.
State 3 picks the next attack with six own-generator draws. State 9 creates a `HateBeam`
object (skill 27 pointer); state 10 a `HateProjectile` (skill 28); 0xb, 0xc and 0xe are
shock attacks with camera shake and a `LightEffect`; 0x12 creates a `Prop` and links it;
0x17 is a particle sequence around two bones. Death (0x14) creates a `Prop` and four
`HateSoul` objects, plays nine sounds and calls 0x277110. takeDamage ignores all damage
while the handle at +0x3e0 is set. `HateBeam` (run 0x2775e8) and `HateProjectile` (run
0x2783e8) apply skill 30 (HateEffect) through a `SpellHateEffect`.

### Marr (`MattMarr`)

Run 0x283afc, setState 0x28468c, death effects 0x284b68. State 9 casts skill 66
PlanarWind and links the spell. setState 0x17 adds skill 94 SpiritShield if he does not
already carry that spell type. 0x284b68 is the death sequence (camera shake, particles
from generator 0x404468, deletes the object).

### Natasla

Run 0x29dbf0 is 76 bytes: the creature run and activity calls and nothing else — no AI
states. Draw 0x29d844 is 940 bytes (not read). **Observed.**

### MummyKing

Run 0x29b360, takeDamage 0x29c544 (ignored while creature flag 0x4000000 is set).
State 7: melee with DiseaseWeapons (25) and PoisonWeapons (26) riders. State 8 creates a
`MummySnake` (run 0x29d0c0, PoisonWeapons rider); state 9 creates two `SpawnMummy` objects
(run 0x29cea8); state 0x17 creates a `DustDevil` (run 0x29cb98).

### SpiderQueen

Run 0x2ad630, takeDamage 0x2aed60. States 6, 7, 10, 0xb: bites with a PoisonWeapons rider.
State 0xc: spits a `PoisonProjectile` (three own draws). States 8–9: jump (0x2afc28).
Helper 0x2b0080 creates `WebTrap` objects (second constructor 0x2b07c0). takeDamage calls
the creature version and then, for each of six legs, hides the leg (bits in +0xe8) and
spawns effect 3 once hit points fall to that leg's threshold.

### VampireLord

Run 0x2b7be0, takeDamage 0x2b93d8: after the creature version, the first time hit points
drop below half it forces state 0x19 (+0x3ec remembers). States 7–0xb: melee chain with a
ColdWeapons (14) rider; states 0x10 and 0x14 create `Critter` objects with four own draws
(0x14 then deletes the lord).

### RedDragon

Run 0x25f988. States 6, 7, 8, 0x1c, 0x1d: bites and claws; 9, 10: tail; 0xb–0xe: breath
(helper 0x261328 twice plus arc tests); 0xf creates a `FireStorm` spell object; 0x1b picks
one of 0xb–0xf from four range tests.

### Nightmare

Run 0x270bbc: states 6, 0x17, 0x18 kicks; 7 charge. It is also the mount object of the
mounted Horsemen.

### Others with boss-like behaviour (script summary only)

Agony (`AvatarAgony`): melee only. AntQueen: state 0x19 creates an `AntWave`; bites carry
a PoisonWeapons rider. GnawSpawn: creates three `Prop` objects per spawn state. Minion:
state 9 queries FrostStorm (58) four times and makes a `LightEffect`; 0x17 creates a
`Soul`. IronGuardian: state 9 fires a projectile, 10 a `JunkProjectile`, and its tail
creates a `Droid`.

## 5. Level objects

### Container (barrels, crates, pots, kegs) — run 0x290e78

Constructors 0x2909b0 (type `Container`) and 0x290c24 (all the named barrels and pots).
Loot is rolled in the run function on the frame the break state +0x80 is 1, **from the
container's own generator** (`GameObject_rand(this)`, seeded from the shared generator when
the container was constructed):

1. Skipped entirely when the level name is `tutor`, or when flag 0x20 is set.
2. One draw is discarded, then a `Gold` object is created with amount
   `(draw & 3) × level_monsterLevelTimes0_4() + 1`.
3. One draw below 7500 of 65536 (11.4 %) → items. Count: 1, or 2 when the next draw is
   ≥ 63000, or 3 when ≥ 65500; two more when the level name contains `tower`. One further
   draw is compared with 10000 (30000 in `tower` levels): below → every item is the named
   item `arrows` (0x1069b8), otherwise every item comes from `item_generateConsumable`
   (0x108590), **which draws from the shared generator** (seven uses in its body).
4. Independently, one draw ≤ 1.5 % → a potion stack: `firepotion`, `explodingpotion` or
   `gaspotion` by thirds of the next draw, quantity 3–6.
5. Every dropped item is thrown in a random direction within ±45° of the container's
   facing (one draw each).

Explosive containers (flag 4): the fuse +0x74 runs 180 frames, then an area hit through
`world_damageInRadius` (0x161270) (float arguments 40 and 180) with damage `(monster level − 2) × 20 + 15`, a camera shake, a
`LightEffect` and debris props; the container deletes itself. A container that is pushed
keeps a velocity that decays by 0.86 per frame and leaves the run list when it stops.

### Chest — interact 0x292a2c, run 0x2923a8

First interact: opening animation and sound, `+0x84 = 1`, `+0x50 = frame`, joins the run
list; the interact flag is cleared when no gold is inside. Loot comes from the chest's
level-file parameters, in this order:
- every `item=<name>`: that named item (0x1069b8);
- `potions=<n>`: n times `item_generateConsumable` (shared generator);
- every `random=<value>`: an item of worth `2 × value × level_monsterLevelTimesDifficulty()
  × (0.95 + own draw × 0.1) × 600` built by `item_generateWithAffixes`, with one own draw
  mod 3 choosing an entry of the table at 0x5016b8;
- then one `loot_generateDrops` call.
A second interact while gold remains gives the gold (+0x4c) to that player. A trapped chest
(+0x58) explodes 90 frames after opening: the same area hit with damage
`(monster level − 2) × 4 + 15`.

### AutoChest / AutoProp / AutoContainer family

`AutoObject` (constructor 0x23a354, draw 0x23aa20) is the base of 16 data-driven classes;
the `…LP` variants and `EggSack`, `DiseasePort` share run 0x2421e0 and draw 0x241ee4.
`autoobject_dropLoot` (0x23ba3c; called from AutoChest_run 0x23b170, AutoProp_run 0x23cb54
and 0x23d2ec) follows the same parameter scheme as Chest — `spawncreep`, `item`, `potions`,
`random` — and otherwise three `loot_generateDrops` calls plus one own draw: below 5000 →
`arrows`, below 15000 → a consumable. AutoContainer_run (0x23e430, 5,680 bytes) repeats
the Container logic with a `reduceCarnage` parameter; it was only skimmed.

### Generator (`AntMaker`) — run 0x265938

A creature-derived object. Returns at once when `Creature_updateActive` says inactive.
State 0 (dormant) wakes to state 3 when it sees a player: flag bit 1 set → a 500-unit ray
ahead (0x18ad94) hitting a player, or, every 8th frame (frame counter xor +0x230), any
living player in a 400-unit box centred 200 units ahead; bit 1 clear and bit 0 clear → the
ray only; bit 1 clear and bit 0 set → it never wakes by itself. State 3: when the previous spawn is dead or absent and fewer than +0x3d4 have
been made, creates an object of type +0x3c8 through the factory, and for a creature stores
the type name at +0x34, sets creature flag 0x1000000 and links it at +0x3e0.
`ScriptGenerator` (constructor 0x265f54) is the script-driven version: 0x265fc4 spawns the
type it is given and puts a Skeleton into state 0x17.

### CreatureContainer — run 0x2437ec

Follows the object in its handle +0x3c8 (copies its position and re-links the grid cell)
and queues itself for deletion when the handle is empty; otherwise only the base creature
calls. Its constructor 0x243624 also references `AutoContainer`.

### Savepoint (`SavePoint`) — run 0x28cdd0

- Every 8th frame `Savepoint_scanPlayers` (0x28d6dc) counts living players within 120
  units and re-arms the auto-save when nobody is within 150.
- **Resurrection:** in a game with more than one player, when someone is dead and a living
  player is within 120 units, the last player who is dead, for whom `net_isSlotActive` (0x13dd40) is true and
  whose entry in the table at 0x4f84a8 is zero is brought back at the save point with
  `player_respawn`, using one draw from the shared generator (inside the every-8th-frame
  block of Savepoint_run).
- **Auto-save:** armed, at least one player near, none "busy", and not in a no-save zone →
  `save_game(0,0,0)`, mark used.
- **Manual save:** interact (0x28dc30) sets +0x84, asks the memory-card code to open the
  save dialog for that player, lights the point and fires its `action` scripts. The
  "saved" burst (+0xcc 1→4: a sound, an animation, four rings of particles from the
  point's own generator, `+0x80 = 1`) starts when game message type 5 arrives.
- State saved in the level record: +0x80 (or +0x84), +0xc5, +0xc6.

### JumpGate (`Portal`, `PortalHurt`) — run 0x27cb58

- A `script` parameter names a script that is run every frame while the gate is in use;
  its result enables the gate.
- First activation (+0x4d = 0): when every living player is within 100 units, calls
  `JumpGate_openMenu(player, destination parameter, notDrawn)` and sets +0x4d.
- Later (+0x4d = 1): the same test, but only on frames where +0xd0 is set (see 7.1), and
  only when no task named `jumpgate` exists.
- `jumpgate_menuRun` (0x27dd74) is a run task: state 0 finds the current level in the
  destination list and, when the gate has a destination parameter, skips to state 4;
  offline it also pauses the game. State 2 reads the chosen player's lockstep pad: cancel,
  confirm (sets 0x500ae8 to 1), up/down. State 5 counts 0x500ae8 to 180 and then writes the
  next world name to 0x41b6d0. `script_gamePaused` reads 0x500ae8.
- The destination list (0x8e3a50) is saved and loaded by 0x27dcf4 / 0x27dd30; a level adds
  itself with 0x27db60.

### Teleporter — run 0x28ef0c

The run function only emits two particles per frame from the object's own generator. The
class is creature-derived (0x3c8 bytes); whatever moves the player is not in its run,
draw or setState (0x28f154 is an empty function). **Unknown** where the teleport happens —
probably the creature interact path or a level script.

### Trap (`Trap`) — run 0x29507c

Every 32nd frame: box query of its radius; every living player inside takes a hit through
`damage_apply` (20–30, flag 0x40, plus 0x4000000 on every 64th frame) with a rider: skill
13 FireWeapons when the object has a `fire` parameter, otherwise skill 26 PoisonWeapons.
The rider strength is that skill's +0x5c value at the monster level × 0.15.

### Lever, Timer, Counter and the `action` mechanism

`0x14dcc8(object, on)` (objects area) runs, for every `action=<name>` parameter of the
object, the script `<name>` when `on` is non-zero and `not<name>` when it is zero.
- Lever: interact starts the swing; run moves +0x4c by 1.5/60 per frame and at the end
  fires the action — "on" when the `onOnly` parameter is set or the lever moved forward,
  never "on" when `offOnly` is set — flips direction and becomes usable again unless one
  of those parameters is set.
- Timer: slot 3 starts it with `time` × 60 frames and remembers the value; run counts down
  and fires the action with that value, then leaves the run list.
- Counter: slot 3 counts up for a non-zero value and down for zero; on reaching the
  `count` parameter (default 1) fires the action (forced on by `onOnly`, off by `offOnly`).
- FloorSwitch, Switch, DoorSwing, DoorSecret, RollDoor, FallPlatform are the `WorldPart`
  classes (tables 0x50de28–0x50e100); not read.

### Lights

Torch (also `Fire`, `Campfire`, `Firepot`, `Firepot2`, `OilLamp`), Candle, Candle2
(`Candle3`), Lamp, Lantern. A light is put on the run list by its draw function and takes
itself off after 31 undrawn frames; see 7.4. Torch's touch handler 0x2b2860 burns whoever
touches it with a FireWeapons rider and one shared-generator draw.

### DragonGoldPile, WeaponRack, others

DragonGoldPile_run (0x295d58) only makes sparkles (see 7.3). WeaponRack has no run
function. LightningRod (run 0x295954) creates `LightningBolt` objects. SpiritAnchor has
its own takeDamage (0x296888). Not read further.

## 6. Skills cast by monsters

Skill ids index the table at 0x41b170. "cast" is a call through the skill's own table at
offset 0x14, "can-cast test" at offset 0x0c, "value query" at 0x5c or 0x64 (used to size an
elemental rider or an effect); a bare pointer means the skill object is handed to a spell
or projectile constructor. **Observed** by script over every function of each class; the
Horsemen, Cazic and Trap rows were also read by hand.

## 7. Per-machine state

Method. For every function in the range a script searched the decompile for reads of the
camera globals (0x44f038–0x44f168), the cosmetic generators (0x404460, 0x404468), the
render counters (0x44fdd0, 0x506048), the prediction-copy and menu globals, the pad block,
and for calls to `net_getLocalPlayerSlot`, `net_isLocalSlot`, the audio status functions,
`isNearCameraFocus480`, `isNearView`; and, for every draw function and everything it calls
inside this range, for `GameObject_rand`, the shared generator, `pool_new`, run-list
changes and `script_runByName`, and for stores into the object. Virtual calls and
functions outside the range (all of the creature base, the weapon helper, effects) were
not followed. Hits were then read by hand. "None found" below means none by that method.

Not repeated per class: every monster run function calls `Creature_run`,
`Creature_updateActive` and `Creature_processDamage` (0x110d30), and every monster draw calls `Creature_draw`; their
known hazards (FINDINGS D6, D12–D14) apply to all 73 creature classes.

### 7.1 JumpGate: run logic depends on whether the gate was drawn — Observed

- `JumpGate_draw` (0x27d634) begins by storing 1 at +0xd0. `JumpGate_run` (0x27cb58) tests
  +0xd0 throughout and stores 0 on every exit path.
- For a gate that has been opened before (+0x4d = 1) the run function returns early when
  +0xd0 is 0 (branch after 0x27d1d8). Skipped on such a frame: the own-generator particle
  draws, the animation step, and **the test "all living players within 100 units → open
  the travel menu"** (`JumpGate_openMenu` adds the run task `jumpgate_menuRun`).
- +0xd0 is also what decides the light on/off every 32nd frame, the six own-generator
  draws of the active effect, and the third argument of `JumpGate_openMenu`, which becomes
  0x8e3c38 (read only by the travel effect).
- Whether +0xd0 is set when run executes differs between machines: the gate may be outside
  one camera's frustum, the draw pass may stop early (FINDINGS D13), and when a machine
  simulates two frames between two rendered frames the second one sees 0.
- **Inferred consequence:** the frame on which the travel menu task starts — and with it
  0x500ae8, which `script_gamePaused` reads, the 180-frame countdown and the frame the next
  world name is written — can differ between machines. With a gate that has a
  `destination` parameter there is no menu input to re-align them: state 0 goes straight
  to the countdown. Not confirmed on a running game.

### 7.2 Jump-gate travel effect writes player fields from a draw task — Observed

`jumpgate_travelEffect` (0x27e770) is called only from the draw task `jumpgate_menuDraw`
(call at 0x27e66c; the task is registered as a draw task at 0x27da84, inside
`JumpGate_openMenu`). It stores into every living player's object: +0xf0 = frame counter
and +0x394 = 0x78 when the countdown is at 30 (menu path), and, on the automatic path with
a 1-in-10 chance per player per drawn frame from the cosmetic generator, the eight shorts
at +0x90…+0x9e. +0x394 is status counter 10 (drawing only, FINDINGS D15). +0xf0 is read by
`Creature_run` at 0x113768, inside the status-counter-7 branch. **Inferred:** harmless
unless counter 7 is running on that player (D16).

### 7.3 DragonGoldPile_run reads the camera — Observed

0x295d58 compares the camera position (0x44f038) and two camera orientation values
(0x44f118, 0x44f124) with copies kept in the object (+0x4c…+0x60); when the camera moved
it makes two sparkles, each placed with three or more draws from **the pile's own
generator**, then stores the new camera values. So the pile's generator state and those
fields differ between machines. Nothing else in the class reads them (**Observed**: the
class has only this run function and inherited slots); **Inferred:** no effect on shared
state.

### 7.4 Lights join the run list from draw code — Observed

`Torch_draw` 0x2b2ae8 clears a "frames since drawn" byte (+0x89) and, when the torch is
not running (+0x88 = 0), calls `obj_runEveryFrame` (0x14f248) (link into the every-frame run list) and sets
+0x88. `Candle_draw` 0x2b30ac, `Candle2_draw` 0x2b33b4, `Lantern_draw` 0x2b3638 and
`Lamp_draw` 0x2b3a64 make the same call and the same two byte stores (found by script,
not read line by line). The run functions count the byte up and call `obj_stopRunning` (0x14f290) after
31 frames. Which lights run, and where they sit in the run list, therefore differs between
machines. Their run functions (0x2b2088, 0x2b2dc4, 0x2b3164, 0x2b3554, 0x2b3858) call only
`GameObject_rand(this)`, the sine table, the particle emitter and `obj_stopRunning` (0x14f290) (Lantern_run also
calls `libc_strstr`), and write only their own light fields; Torch_run and Torch_draw also use the object's address as a noise
phase. **Inferred:** no effect on shared state; the lights' own generators are not in sync.
`Torch_onTouch` (0x2b2860), which does use the shared generator, is called from collision
code, not from the run list.

### 7.5 AntWave draws from its own generator in draw code — Observed

`AntWave_draw` (0x2387d0): when the object's age is a multiple of 3 it takes three or more
values from `GameObject_rand(this)` to place a particle. `AntWave_run` (0x238938) moves the
object toward its target with the path helper `Creature_moveTo` (0x114510), which takes a value from the same
generator to choose a turn direction when blocked (0x114510, call to `GameObject_rand`),
and every 60 frames damages the target when within its radius. **Inferred consequence:**
on machines that drew the wave a different number of times, a blocked wave turns
differently, so its position and the damage it does can diverge. AntWave objects are
created only by AntQueen_run (state 0x19).

### 7.6 Savepoint — Observed

- `Savepoint_interact` (0x28dc30) acts only when `memcard_isBusy()` and
  `menuMutex_isHeld()` are both false. The first is this machine's memory-card state. What
  it gates: +0x84, the light, and `0x14dcc8(this, 1)`, which **runs the save point's
  `action` scripts**. A machine whose card code is busy (for example the one already
  showing the save dialog) skips them. **Inferred:** matters only for save points that have
  an `action` parameter and are used twice in quick succession.
- `Savepoint_run` clears +0x84 from `memcard_getState()` and from the save-finished flag
  0x4f8f29, both per machine. While +0x84 and +0xcc are set it draws from the point's own
  generator and sets +0x80 (which is written to the level save record by slot 9).
- The "saved" burst is started by game message type 5. `hudmsg_sendSavepoint` (0x1de1a0)
  puts the Savepoint's **address** into the message; the handler (`hud_onMsg` case 5, call
  at 0x1d8f00) passes the received word to `Savepoint_startSavedEffect` (0x28cdc4), which stores 1 at
  address+0xcc with no check. A pointer value is sent between machines and dereferenced.
  **Inferred:** correct only while every machine has that object at the same address; if
  not, one word of unrelated memory is overwritten.
- `Savepoint_scanPlayers` sets +0xc9 through `net_isLocalSlot`; +0xc9 only selects who sees
  a HUD line (run, `net_getLocalPlayerSlot` at the end of 0x28cdd0).
- The resurrection and the auto-save use only lockstep state: player positions, hit
  points, the frame counter, the shared generator.

### 7.7 Scripts run from draw code — Observed

`NPC_draw` (0x29e3ec), `Gnome_draw` (0x2691f0), `GnomeNavigator_draw` (0x26a000) and
`Rondo_draw` (0x29f28c): when the structure at 0x4f8450 has 1 at +0x34 and the object has
an `exclamation` parameter, the function runs that script through `script_runByName` on
every drawn frame and draws a marker when it returns 1. The one such script found by name
(`check1Exclam` / `check2Exclam` in INNOVAT1) only reads: getEvil, getv, playerHasItem.
**Inferred:** harmless unless some level's exclamation script writes a variable or calls
getRand; the other levels' scripts were not checked.

### 7.8 UndeadKnight_draw copies uninitialised stack into the position — Observed, unreachable

0x2b421c, when the mount handle +0x3c8 is set: 12 bytes are loaded from the top of the
function's own stack frame, which nothing has written (0x2b424c–0x2b426c), and stored to
the position; facing is set to 0; a bone offset is subtracted; nothing is restored. The
handle is cleared by the constructor and no code links it (**Observed**: field search for
+0x3c8 between 0x2b3e30 and 0x2b5370 finds only the clear and reads), so the path is
**Inferred** dead. The mounted knights in the game are `Horsemen`, whose draw (0x2721f8)
builds a matrix from the mount instead and writes nothing.

### 7.9 Smaller items

| Where | What | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| Cazic_deathEffects 0x24c994, Marr death 0x284b68 | use generator 0x404468 for beam jitter and particle scatter; the counts of own-generator draws depend only on the death timer | Observed; cosmetic |
| every monster constructor (0x271dd8 in Horsemen_ctor, 0x24a73c in Cazic_ctor, 0x2a8898 in Skelight_ctor) | stores the frame counter at +0xec ("hits register from"); the counter equals the lockstep frame only inside a simulated tick | Observed store; Unknown whether any constructor runs outside a tick with differing values |
| Skelight_ctor 0x2a8770 | swaps the global monster level 0x4f714c during construction | Observed; lockstep as long as the caller is |
| OniBall_run 0x2941e4, OniBall_onTouch 0x2946f8 | read `g_pads[player]+8` (the lockstep pad block) to decide whether the orb flies to the player; the touch handler tests the prediction-copy flag 0x20000 | Observed; not a hazard |
| jumpgate_menuRun 0x27dd74 state 2 | when `net_isLocalSlot(player)` and `pauseMenu_isOpen` (0x18cbfc) are both true it calls `net_lockLocalInput` (0x13e4e8)(player, 4) instead of reading the pad | Observed; whether the other machines see the same thing on that frame is Unknown |
| jumpgate_beginTravel 0x27e6a8 | copies the camera position into 0x8e3918 for the effect | Observed; cosmetic |
| Container_run 0x290e78 | keeps a sound handle at +0x78 and stops it on explosion | Observed; audio only |
| Catapult_draw 0x24dc40, NPC_draw 0x29e3ec | read the camera to orient what they draw | Observed; no store to shared state found |
| Critter, FireBeetle, FireFly, Mosquito, AntQueen draw | store to position or facing fields; not read (expected to be a temporary offset restored after drawing) | Unknown |
| AutoObject_draw 0x23aa20 and the LP draws | store to the object flag word +0xc; LP draws read the render frame counter 0x44fdd0 | Unknown which flag; not read |
| Creep_draw 0x253514 | stores to the creature flag word +0xa8 | Unknown; not read |

### 7.10 What was looked for and not found

- No draw function in this range (or anything it calls inside the range) creates an
  object, draws from the shared generator 0x404464, or queries the world; the only draw
  functions that draw from an object generator or run a script are the ones above.
- No run function in this range reads the hardware timer, the audio stream position or
  status, the raw pads, or the prediction-copy globals.
- Horsemen, Cazic (avatar), Skelight, Skeleton and UndeadKnight — the Drundar arena set —
  make no per-machine read in their own run, setState, draw or helper functions. What they
  share with every monster is the creature base, the weapon helper object at +0x50 (its
  update is called from run at table offsets 0xac/0xb4 and its draw from draw at 0x94/0x9c;
  class at table 0x50cda0, not in this area, **not read**) and the skills they cast.

## 8. Corrections to earlier notes

- **Cazic's run function is 0x24aaf0, not 0x248598.** 0x248598 is `Bubo_run`. The
  "ruled out" paragraph of FINDINGS that says the function at 0x248598 reads no camera or
  local-player state was checking the wrong class. Having read the right one: the same
  conclusion holds for 0x24aaf0 and its helpers (7.10).
- The `names.tsv` note on `Cazic_ctor` ("casts FireStorm and SummonSkeleton") is true only
  of the `cazicthule` variant above half health; the `cazicavatar` variant casts neither
  (section 4).
- Horsemen variant 3 does not wait for its skill timer: it casts SummonSkeleton whenever
  the skill's "can cast" test passes (0x2726a0–0x27271c); only variants 0–2 are gated by
  +0x474.
- State 0x14 is the death state, not a cutscene state (1.4).
- 13 tables that `vtables.txt` lists as `Projectile`, `WorldPart` or `FireBeetle` are
  derived classes whose type-info function names the base first: 0x50de28 FallPlatform,
  0x50deb8 FloorSwitch, 0x50df48 Switch, 0x50dfd8 DoorSecret, 0x50e068 RollDoor, 0x50e100
  DoorSwing, 0x50e3d8 beetleProjectile, 0x50e638 IceBall, 0x50e758 Root, 0x50e7e8
  LostSoul, 0x50e878 OniBall, 0x50e998 Sparks, 0x5108c8 FireFly (**Observed**: the last
  class-name string referenced by each type-info function).

## 9. Open questions

1. Does the arena's Cazic object really have type `cazicavatar`? Read the object list of
   the DRUNARE world file.
2. JumpGate (7.1): does any shipped level reuse an already opened gate with a
   `destination` parameter in a net game? Two running copies would settle whether the
   start frames differ.
3. Savepoint message 5 (7.6): are object addresses identical on all machines at that
   point? Compare the address in the message with the local object in a two-machine run.
4. The weapon helper class (table 0x50cda0): its per-frame update and its draw are called
   by Horsemen, Skelight, Skeleton, UndeadKnight and other armed monsters. Does its draw
   change anything its update reads?
5. What exactly SummonSkeleton's "can cast" test (skill table offset 0x0c) counts — it is
   the only limit on knight variant 3's summoning.
6. Meaning of creature table offsets 0xbc, 0xcc, 0xd4, 0xe4 and of slots 10, 12, 17–19, 21,
   36 where classes override them (80 functions are named `Class_vslotN`).
7. Where the Teleporter moves the player.
8. The draw functions that store to position, facing or flag fields (7.9, last three
   rows) should be read to confirm the stores are undone.
9. `net_lockLocalInput` (0x13e4e8)(player, n) and `pauseMenu_isOpen` (0x18cbfc), used by the jump-gate menu for the local player.
10. `Orca`, `lb_block` and a few other factory names could not be attributed with
    certainty.

## 10. What was not done

- Read in full: Horsemen, Cazic, Skelight (all functions); Savepoint, Chest, Container
  (loot part), Generator, CreatureContainer, Timer, Counter, Lever, Trap, Teleporter,
  Torch, DragonGoldPile, AntWave, the JumpGate run function and its menu task.
- Summarised by script only (state → helpers called, objects created, skills used): the
  other 66 creature classes, including Zek, Innoruuk, Marr, MummyKing, SpiderQueen,
  VampireLord, RedDragon and Nightmare. Their damage numbers, ranges and timers are not in
  this document.
- Not read at all: the AutoObject family beyond the loot function (about 60 functions),
  the door and switch classes, the monster projectiles (HateBeam, HateProjectile, LavaBomb,
  FireBomb family, IceBall, Root, LostSoul, Sparks, PoisonProjectile, DiseaseProjectile),
  SpiritAnchor, Catapult, WebTrap, LightningRod, NPC, the 32-byte static-initialiser pairs,
  and the four functions before 0x233bdc.
- 151 of the 885 functions are unnamed: private helpers called from one class, the
  static initialisers, and a few with no caller found. 81 of the named ones are
  `Class_vslotN` — known to be that class's override of slot N and nothing more.

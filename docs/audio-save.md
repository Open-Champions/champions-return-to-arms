# audio-save — sound, save and load, memory card, player selection, dialog, mission menu (0x210000–0x232000)

293 functions. Read from the decompile and the disassembly only; nothing here was seen on a
running game. Names are in `symbols/audio-save.tsv`. Unless a line says *Inferred* or
*Unknown*, a statement is *Observed* at the address given.

## Layout of the range

Boundaries come from the static-constructor table (0x3e99e8 → 0x216bb8, 0x3e99ec →
0x222f54, 0x3e99f0 → 0x22436c) and from which functions call each other.

| Range | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0x210034–0x210cd0 | point lists: level path objects (keys `name`, `barrier`, `continous`, `norotate`, `pcount`, `p`). Not sound; used by creature path following |
| 0x210cd0–0x216bf8 | sound: SPU voices, sound sequences, three streams, IOP calls. The unit with the `sound.cc` asserts |
| 0x216bf8–0x222f74 | save: player snapshot, save buffer build/load, save daemon tasks, every memory-card screen |
| 0x222f74–0x22438c | memory-card operation queue, `monsters.bal` balance table loader, credits |
| 0x22438c–0x22e714 | player selection / character creation, name entry |
| 0x22e714–0x22ec9c | a level-settings parser called by the object factory (camera limits, dust colour …) |
| 0x22ec9c–0x231050 | NPC dialog: message handler, run and draw tasks |
| 0x231050–0x232000 | mission menu (its draw task 0x232300 is past the end of the range) |

Tasks registered here (`task_add(fn, priority, name, isDraw)`):

| Task name | Function | Kind | Priority |

`sound_update` 0x212670 is not a task: the session loop calls it once per displayed frame.

## Save format

### The buffer

`g_saveBuffer` at 0x895580 is 0x4bc78 bytes. The memory-card file is that buffer written in
one piece: `memcard_saveScreen` queues open (mode 0x202), write (0x895580, 0x4bc78), close
(0x218afc, state 2). Loading reads the same number of bytes back and calls `save_load`
(0x219360). Slot files are named `BASLUS-20973_slot<n>` in the directory `BASLUS-20973`
(`memcard_makeSlotName` 0x21effc). `save_init` also builds the name `BASLUS-20565_config`
(at 0x88d438); where it is used was not traced.

`save_build(savepointArg, onePlayer)` 0x221914 writes everything up to the level directory;
`save_storeLevelState` adds the current level's object state.

| Offset | Size | Field | Per | Written at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | char[0x14] | level name (0x41b721), or the text `gameComplete` after the end of the game | game | 0x2219e4 |
| +0x14 | char[0x50] | second part of the level name (0x41b771), empty if none | game | 0x2219f4 |
| +0x64 | u32 | play time in seconds (`g_playTimeSeconds`) | machine | 0x221a14 |
| +0x68 | u16 | size of a player record, 0x4c30 | — | 0x221a3c |
| +0x6a | u16 | number of players in the file | game | 0x221a28 |
| +0x6c | u8 | difficulty index (`g_difficultyIdx`) | game | 0x221a48 |
| +0x6d | u8 | first argument of `save_game` | game | 0x221a44 |
| +0x6e | u16 | act index (`g_currentAct`) | game | 0x221a04 |
| +0x70 | 0xc4 | camera state from `Camera_saveState` 0x203918: position (12), 4 × 4 words from 0x44f110, two u16, five words, 0x60 bytes of camera +0x100 | machine | 0x221a54 |
| +0x134 | 0x1e4 | jump-gate destinations: u32 count byte, 0x1e0 bytes from 0x8e3a50 (`jumpgate_saveDestinations`) | game | 0x221a60 |
| +0x318 | u32 | minimap mode (`g_minimapMode` 0x4f8400) | machine | after 0x221a60 |
| +0x31c | u32 | `g_numPlayers` | game | same |
| +0x320 | 4 × 0x4c3e | player blocks (below); blocks past the player count are left untouched | character | loop from 0x221abc |
| +0x13418 | n × 0x24 | quest variables: char name[0x20], s32 value; reading stops at an empty name | game | 0x221cf0–0x221d18 |
| +0x16010 | 10 × 0x18 | level directory: char name[0x14], u32 size | game | `save_storeLevelState` 0x21777c |
| +0x16118 | rest | level states, concatenated in directory order | game | `save_writeLevelState` 0x218600 |

The two variable-length sections at +0x70 and +0x134 have fixed sizes in this build (the
writers return 0xc4 and 0x1e4), but every reader recomputes the offsets by calling the
writers into a scratch buffer (`save_playerBlock` 0x2184a4), so treat the later offsets as
derived.

Player block (0x4c3e bytes):

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | 2 | bytes +0x38 and +0x39 of the player's object (facing angle) |
| +0x02 | 12 | object position x, y, height |
| +0x0e | 0x4c30 | the player record, taken from the snapshot table `g_savedPlayers` 0x879ec0 |

If the player has no object, position and angle come from the "best" living player
(index 0x4f841c) or the first player that has one (0x221b20).

`save_snapshotPlayer(slot)` 0x216c80 copies the live record and makes it position
independent:

- each item record's first word (pointer into the static item table 0x3f7650, 0x40 bytes
  per row) becomes a row number (0x107ea4);
- the 17 equipped-item pointers at +0x43f0, the two at +0x4434/+0x4438 and the one at
  +0x443c become `bag * 1000 + index`, or −1 (`save_itemPtrToIndex` 0x216bf8).

`save_fixupPlayer(slot)` 0x216ea8 does the reverse on the live record and zeroes the object
pointer +0x43d8.

Level state: `save_storeLevelState(name)` looks the level up in the directory (adding it if
there is room; at most 10 levels and the whole buffer must stay under 0x4bc78) and has
`save_writeLevelState` write three length-prefixed sections produced by 0x14e5c8 (objects),
0x19ee10 and 0x16865c. The size reserved per level comes from the act table (0x4f8e48:
per act a list of {name, u16 size}; 0x4f8e10 counts; 0x4f8e7c number of acts). Skipped
while the card state is 4 or a flag in 0x44fe08 is set.

### What is per character and what is per game

- Per character: the 0x4c30-byte record — name, class, level, experience, stats, points,
  gold, three bags of 64 items, equipment, quest list text, abilities, and the evil /
  decision bit bytes at +0x4c1a/+0x4c1b.
- Per game: level, act, difficulty, quest variables, jump-gate list, level states.
- Per machine but stored anyway: play time, camera, minimap mode.

In a net game the file holds only the local character: `save_packLocalPlayer` 0x2223d4
copies the local slot's block to position 0 and writes a player count of 1 before the
write; `save_unpackLocalPlayer` 0x222580 restores the buffer afterwards. Level, quest
variables and level states in that file are whatever this machine's buffer held.

### Reading back

`save_load` 0x221d60:

1. copies the 0x70-byte header to `g_saveHeaderCopy` 0x879e38;
2. restores the camera and jump-gate sections (0x203a20, 0x27dd30), minimap mode and
   `g_numPlayers`;
3. for each player: angle to 0x4f8410, position to 0x4f70d0 (used when the objects are
   created), record straight into `g_players`, `save_fixupPlayer`;
4. `vars_clearAll`, then `vars_set` for each quest-variable record;
5. sets the "loaded from save" flag 0x8e1ad6, the act, the difficulty, play time;
6. builds the pending level name 0x41b6d0 from the two header strings (`a_b` when the
   second is not empty) and marks a level change (0x41b720 = 0xfd);
7. if flag 0x4f85b4 is set, `inventory_shareQuestItems(0)`;
8. sets the autosave countdown to 99, which the daemon treats as "skip one".

The level states are not parsed here; the level loader consumes them.

Callers: `memcard_loadScreen` (draw task, front end or pause menu) and `save_reload` from
`deathTask` (party wipe in a level with a checkpoint).

### When saves are made

- `save_game(arg, quiet)` 0x218128 — callers script `saveCheckPoint`, `Savepoint_run`, and
  the daemon. It needs at least one living player, shows "CheckPoint" or the level name on
  the HUD, then `save_build(arg, 0)`. It fills the buffer only; nothing is written to the
  card.
- `save_daemonRun` (run task) counts play time and runs the autosave: `save_armAutosave`
  0x217f14 sets the countdown to 1 after a level load, and the daemon calls
  `save_game(0, 1)` when the card state is idle, not in the front end, not PvP, no
  full-screen menu, camera mode 1 and the game not paused.
- `memcard_requestSave(slot)` 0x2175b4 (script `saveGame`, pause menu, savepoint) opens the
  card screen, which rebuilds the buffer (offline) or only packs the local player into the
  existing buffer (net game, see A1) and writes the file.
- Config: `memcard_requestConfigSave` (state 5), `memcard_requestEndGameSave` (state 6).
- `save_clearBuffer(full)` 0x21f144 zeroes the buffer; with `full` = 0 it keeps the first
  directory entry and its level state.

### Memory-card machinery

`g_memcardState` 0x88d3a0 selects the screen `save_daemonDraw` runs: 0 and 1 config load,
3 save, 4 load, 5 config save, 6 end-game save, 9 import character, 10 options; −1 idle.
`memcard_setState` 0x21f238. Card calls go through a 256-entry ring (`mc_queueOp` 0x223470:
0 open, 1 close, 3 read, 5 write, 6 file info, 8 init) pumped by `mc_pump` 0x223064;
`mc_wait` blocks. Offline, opening a card screen pushes and sets `g_paused`
(`memcard_pushPause` 0x21e850); in a net game it does not touch it.

The import screen (0x21fa2c) lists saves under both `BASLUS-20973` and `BASLUS-20565`.

## Sound

### What game code calls

| Function | Arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `sound_playOnObject` 0x214230 (180 callers) | float volume, sequence, object or 0 | handle or −1 |
| `sound_playAtPos` 0x214428 (61 callers) | float volume, sequence, position | handle or −1 |
| `sound_stop` 0x213ea0 | handle | — |
| `sound_release` 0x213438 | handle: let it play out | — |
| `sound_setVolume` 0x214650 | float volume, sequence handle | — |
| `sound_setPlaysWhileFrozen` 0x216ad0 | sequence handle | — |
| `sound_playSample` 0x2134e8 | float pitch scale, float volume, float delay in seconds, sample, position or 0 | voice index or −1 |
| `voice_setPosition` 0x2168e8 | float range scale, voice, position | — |
| `sound_muteFor` 0x216588 | seconds | — |
| `audio_streamStatus` 0x211b20 | stream 0–2 | non-zero while busy |
| `audio_streamPosition` 0x216480 | stream | driver position, 0 if the stream is inactive |
| `audio_streamStop` 0x211ce8 | stream | — |
| `stream_playLevel` 0x215fc8 / `music_playLevel` 0x215f48 / `music_playGlobal` 0x2110e0 | (stream,) entry name, flags | — |
| `stream_queueStop` 0x211338 | stream | — |

A *sequence* is a `.anm` entry of a sound lump (usually `fx.lmp`, fetched with 0x17365c):
an animation whose events start samples. A handle with bit 15 set is `slot | generation <<
8 | 0x8000`; without it, a voice index.

### Sequence slots (`g_soundSeqs` 0x871a68, 32 × 0x4c)

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | — | animation player state (initialised by 0x170838) |
| +0x04 | u8 | active |
| +0x06 | u16 | flags; 0x80 = finished |
| +0x08 | ptr | the sequence; its byte +0x3c is a category |
| +0x28 | handle | object being followed (linked into the object's handle list) |
| +0x2c | Vec3 | position, refreshed from the object each update |
| +0x38 | u16 | generation, from a 7-bit counter (0x4f8950) |
| +0x3a | u8 | 1 = no position: plays at the camera |
| +0x3b | u8 | 1 = keeps playing while the game is frozen; initialised from `game_isFrozen()` at start |
| +0x3c | u8 | release requested |
| +0x40 | float | volume |
| +0x44, +0x48 | float | near 360 and far 840 attenuation distances |

Starting a sequence fails (−1) when all 32 slots are busy or when the number of active
sequences in the same category has reached the limit in the byte table 0x4f8a28 (category
0 is unlimited). `soundSeq_updateAll` 0x2147c0 steps every slot once per `sound_update`;
while a slot is being stepped its index is in `g_curSoundSeq` (0x4f8a00) and any sample it
starts is stamped with the slot and generation.

### Voices (`g_voices` 0x872880, 43 × 0x14)

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | ptr | sample (sample +0x20 base pitch, +0x24 SPU address, +0x28 loop flag) |
| +0x04 | u16 | 1 release, 2 paused by freeze, 4 in use, 8 plays while frozen, 0x10 looping |
| +0x06 | s16 | owning sequence slot or −1 |
| +0x08 | s16 | owning sequence generation |
| +0x0c | s32 | pitch |
| +0x10 | float | volume |

`voice_alloc` 0x2169f8 walks the 43 voices round robin. Table 0x4f8960 maps a voice to
(SPU core, voice bit). Register writes are batched as 8-byte commands at 0x875c00 (count
0x4f89e8, at most 512) with key-on / key-off masks per core at 0x872be0 / 0x872be8;
`sound_flushSpuCommands` 0x210cd0 sends the batch. Every 8th frame `sound_update` reads two
SPU switch registers (*Inferred*: the end flags) and frees non-looping voices whose bit is
set. Stopping a sequence stops every
voice stamped with its slot and generation. `g_delayedSamples` holds up to 32 samples
waiting for their start frame.

Left / right volume come from `sound_panAtten` 0x213c50: distance from the camera position
0x44f038 (full volume inside 360, zero at the far distance) and the dot product with the
camera's right vector (0x44f110, 0x44f11c, 0x44f128).

### Streams (`g_streams` 0x876c10, 3 × 0x1c4)

Stream 2 is music (every music call uses it) and stream 1 is speech (dialog); what plays
on stream 0 was not established. Each stream has an
8-entry queue at +0x40 (0x30 bytes per entry: file name, offset, length, three driver
parameters, flags) with the count at +0x1c0. Entry flags seen: 2 stop marker, 8 hold until
released, 0x20 music, 0x40 tested by recall and level change before queuing a stop. The
audio data is in `<level>.vat` (or `mouth.vat` for global entries) and the index is a
`dialog.bin` table of 0x50-byte entries (name, s16 language at +0x4a, offset at +0x40; the
length is the next entry's offset minus this one).

The IOP driver is called through `sceSifCallRpc` with client data 0x877160: function 0x50
returns a 0x40-byte status block at 0x8771c0 (four words per stream; word 3 is the
position), 0x60 stops a stream, 0x80 sets volumes, 0x40 is issued by `stream_startHeld` (*Inferred*:
starts a held entry). Calls are
made in blocking mode, so `audio_streamStatus` and `audio_streamPosition` cost a round trip
to the IOP each time.

Volume: `g_sfxVolume` 0x4f8940, `g_musicVolume` 0x4f8944, stereo flag 0x4f8948; music is
ducked while stream 1 plays (`music_updateDucking` 0x212500).

## Player selection, dialog, mission menu

- Player selection (0x2243f8–0x22e6a4) runs from the front end: `playerSel_start` 0x2245b8
  is called by `frontend_startPlayerSelect` and by netlib 0x324288. `playerSel_task` is one
  18.7 KB draw-task function (class, sex, appearance, name entry, import). It writes
  `g_players` through `player_initNewCharacter` and the quest variable `needPlayers`. No
  level script calls `setupPlayerSel`, `startPlayerSel` or `playerSelRunning` (searched the
  120 decompiled scripts), so none of this runs inside the simulation.
- Dialog. Script `startDialog` → `dialog_start` 0x22fa50, which sends message 0 only from
  the machine that owns the script's active player. Channel id at 0x8e2e94, handler
  `dialog_onMsg` 0x22ee2c:

  | Type | Content | Effect |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 | name length, NPC name, padding, player slot, two flags, sender's camera position (3 floats) and two camera angles (s16) | closes local menus, sets every machine's camera from the message, loads `<npc>.dbin`, runs each node's condition script until one accepts, shows that node |
  | 1 | — | confirm: finish the text reveal, scroll, or take the selected choice (runs the choice's script, then the next node or the end) |
  | 2 | s8 delta | move the choice cursor |
  | 3 | — | end: frees buffers, stops stream 1, queues a level change if the dialog named one, runs the post-action script, opens the shop if the dialog asked for it |
  | 4 | — | request the closing camera move |

  `dialog_runTask` (run task) reads the **raw** pad of the local player and sends 1, 2, 3 or
  4. It sends "confirm" only when the local speech stream is idle or speech is disabled.
- Mission menu: `missionMenu_run` is a run task that reads the lockstep pad of the player
  who opened it (0x4fe7ec) and so behaves the same on every machine.

## Per-machine state

### A1. The save buffer is compared between machines, but is built and edited per machine — Observed mechanism, Inferred consequence

The character checksum exchange (ui area: `net_sendChecksums` 0x1de46c, handler case 10 in
`hud_onMsg`) runs when `net_allPlayersState2` (0x1ec5d8) is true, every 240 simulated
frames. Each machine computes two values per player: the checksum of the live record, and
the checksum of that player's record **inside this machine's save buffer**
(`save_playerBlock(i)`, call at 0x1de4d0). It sends the pair for its own slot; every
machine compares each received pair with its own pair for that slot, and on a difference
sets `g_checksumFailed` and, unless the slot is its own, calls `net_disconnectPlayer` for
it. So the player blocks of `g_saveBuffer` are shared state as far as this check goes.
These things change them on one machine only:

- **Memory-card save in a net game.** `memcard_saveScreen` calls `save_packLocalPlayer`
  (0x218d80), which overwrites block 0 with the local player's record and sets the count
  to 1, queues the 0x4bc78-byte write, and calls `save_unpackLocalPlayer` (0x218e88) only
  when the card operations have finished. The simulation keeps running meanwhile. On a
  machine whose local slot is not 0, a checksum round inside that window compares player
  0's received value with the checksum of the local player's record: a false "bad
  checksum" for player 0 on that machine. *Unknown*: how long the write takes relative to
  the 240-frame round, and how often `net_allPlayersState2` holds (it needs flag 0x4f7134
  and a type value of 2 in every record's +0x4c1c).
- **A failed card write.** The only call to `save_unpackLocalPlayer` is in sub-state 3 of
  the save screen. A card error (result word 0x88d3bc non-zero) sends the screen to
  sub-state 9 instead (test before the sub-state switch in 0x218afc), so the buffer stays
  packed on that machine until the next `save_build`.
- **A reload during the same window.** `save_load` (from `deathTask` → `save_reload`)
  would read a player count of 1 and the local player as player 0 on that machine only.
- **Checkpoint autosave.** `save_daemonRun` is a run task, but its test (0x218924,
  0x218978 and the lines between) reads the memory-card state, the local full-screen-menu
  flag 0x41b4f8 and the local camera mode before calling `save_game(0, 1)` at 0x2189cc. If
  one machine is held back by one of those, it snapshots the players on a later frame than
  the others, and its blocks differ in whatever changed in between. Savepoints and script
  `saveCheckPoint` call `save_game` in lockstep and do not have this problem.

`save_game` itself changes nothing else that is shared: it fills the buffer, shows a HUD
line and calls `net_notify3278f0(−1)`, which reads `g_randSeed` without writing it.

### A2. Dialog progress depends on local audio and local text layout — Observed mechanism, Inferred consequence

- The handler for message 1 (0x22ee2c, case 1) decides between "reveal", "scroll" and
  "take the choice" from 0x8e2cb0/0x8e2cb4 (reveal), 0x8e2ccc/0x8e2cc8/0x8e2cd0 (scroll
  position, target, total height) and 0x8e2ca8/0x8e2cac. Those are advanced by
  `dialog_runTask`, and the total height comes from laying out the localised text
  (`dialog_showNode` 0x230c74). Machines running different languages, or a text that wraps
  differently, would read the same confirm message differently: one takes the choice and
  runs its script, the other scrolls.
- `dialog_runTask` returns early while the opening camera move (0x204250, calls at
  0x22ffa8 and 0x230018) has not finished, so those counters start on the frame the local
  camera arrives. Message 0 forces the camera to the sender's position and angles; whether
  the rest of the camera state is equal was not checked.
- Sending "confirm" is gated by `audio_streamStatus(1)` (0x23032c) and reads the raw local
  pad (0x2300b4, 0x23019c). That only delays a message, which is safe by itself.
- Message 3's handler spins on the engine's loader (0x172ca8) until the asynchronous load
  flag 0x4fdcd5 is set. Blocking only.
- *Unknown*: whether a dialog with choices is reachable in a net game between machines
  set to different languages; the disc carries `sel_en/fr/ge` lumps and a language index
  at 0x44fddc.

### A3. Sound return values are per machine — Observed

`sound_playOnObject` / `sound_playAtPos` / `sound_playSample` return −1 or a slot that
depends on what else is playing on this machine: free slots, the per-category limit, the
mute counter 0x877240 (0x2134f0), the frozen state, and for samples the distance from the
local camera (a non-looping sample whose two volumes come out as zero is not started; test
before 0x2138b0). Sequences end when `sound_update` sees them finish, once per displayed
frame. Any simulation code that branches on a returned handle, or on `audio_streamStatus`,
differs between machines. The 241 call sites were not audited from this side. Known users
of stream state in shared paths: cutscenes (FINDINGS D8, D18), and recall (0x18c230) and
the level-change handlers in `hud_onMsg`, which only decide whether to queue a stream stop.

`sound_playOnObject` links a handle into the object's handle list. That changes the list
contents by machine (which sounds exist), not anything the simulation reads by value.

### A4. Random choices in sound use the cosmetic seed — Observed

0x211238 (random variant among stream entries), 0x214afc and 0x2150c8 / 0x21516c (ambient
and music selection) draw from `g_cosmeticSeed`. `gxref` shows no reference to `g_randSeed`
anywhere in this range.

### A5. Save contents differ by machine — Observed

A save holds this machine's camera, minimap mode, play time and, through the record, the
menu bytes +0xed/+0xee/+0x4a58 (docs/ui.md P4). `save_load` puts them back into
`g_players`. In a net-game file only the local character is present, and its level, quest
variables and level states are those of this machine's buffer.

### A6. Debug flag from the memory card — Observed

`save_init` 0x216fcc sets `g_debugCheats` (0x4f8ee0) when the card has `debug.sht`. Its
readers are in the ui area (docs/ui.md P5).

### A7. Quest variables written outside lockstep — Observed

`save_load` (`vars_clearAll` + `vars_set`) runs from the load screen, a draw task; from
`deathTask` it runs in lockstep. `playerSel_finish` 0x22a360 and 0x229d94 write
`needPlayers` from the selection screen. `profile_setVar` 0x22274c (script `setpv`) writes
a per-profile table and requests a config save on this machine. The selection screen and
the load screen run before the simulation starts.

## Open questions

- A1 and A2 need a running pair of machines. For A1: time the card write against the
  240-frame checksum round with a save made by the player in slot 1.
- The three level-state sections (0x14e5c8, 0x19ee10, 0x16865c) belong to the object,
  engine and animation code; their contents are not described here.
- The 0x60 camera bytes and the meaning of the jump-gate table rows.
- Header byte +0x6d: `save_game`'s first argument; callers pass a savepoint-related value
  that was not traced.
- What plays on stream 0, and the exact meaning of entry
  flags 0x20 / 0x40 and of the three driver parameters in a queue entry.
- Not read beyond their strings and callers: `memcard_browser` 0x219b90 (10 KB),
  `memcard_slotList` 0x21c3a4 (8.7 KB), `memcard_importScreen` 0x21fa2c (7 KB),
  `playerSel_task` 0x225478 (18.7 KB) and its helpers 0x22a524–0x22e6a4, the credits, the
  stream service functions 0x211548 / 0x211df8 / 0x2149d0 / 0x214eb0, sample upload, the
  mission-menu helpers 0x231078–0x2314c8, and the point-list code apart from its accessors.
- Unreferenced functions (0x2128c8, 0x215bf0, 0x215c98, 0x215d28, 0x216050, 0x2161c0,
  0x216230, 0x216b58, 0x217488, 0x217ee8, 0x217fb8, 0x218418, 0x2186a8, 0x21f0dc,
  0x21f210, 0x222694, 0x222964, 0x2234fc) were not read.

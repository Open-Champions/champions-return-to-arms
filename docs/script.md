# Level scripts: the virtual machine and its built-in commands

Area `script`, code range 0x13ecf8–0x147300: the interpreter, 22 library routines of the
virtual machine, 7 shared helpers and 180 built-in handlers (195 functions known to Ghidra plus
15 small routines it missed). The other 10 built-in handlers (0x1473b4–0x14799c) sit just past
the range, in `objects`; they are documented here because the built-in table is one unit.
Symbols: `symbols/script.tsv`.

Everything below was read from the executable and from the 120 decompiled level scripts.
Nothing was confirmed on a running game. Claims are **Observed** unless marked otherwise.

## What this area is

Each level lump may contain a `script.scr`. It is a compiled program for a small
register machine: named entry points, global variables, and calls to 191 built-in commands
implemented in the executable. The game never runs a script continuously. Game code calls one
entry point by name, the interpreter runs it to its `return`, and control goes back. Anything
that takes time is done by a script asking to be called again on the next frame.

The three things a newcomer should know first:

1. **The machine is the Small "abstract machine" (AMX)**, the embeddable interpreter that later
   became Pawn. Its public documentation therefore describes the bytecode, the file header and
   the host interface. See 1.1 for the evidence.
2. **There is one machine per level and no scheduler.** `script_runByName` (0x1ed694) is the
   only way in. It has about 50 call sites: trigger volumes, creature life-cycle events,
   interactable objects, the dialog system, a per-frame "deferred call" queue, and, importantly,
   several **draw** functions (section 5, P1).
3. **Built-ins trust the script completely.** No handler checks its argument count, many do not
   check that a named object exists, strings are copied into fixed stack buffers without a
   length limit, and no handler can report an error to the interpreter.

## 1. The machine

### 1.1 Identification

| Evidence | Where |
|---|---|
| Loader accepts only a header whose 16-bit word at +4 is 0xf1e0 and whose word at +0xa is 0x18 | `scr_load` 0x13e8f8; same magic test in `scr_getFlags` 0x141018 |
| Header layout (code, data, heap, stack top, start address, three name tables of 24-byte records) | `scr_load`, `scr_interpret` 0x13ed78–0x13ee28, `scr_findEntry` 0x13eac8 |
| Error numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16–24 used exactly as in AMX | `scr_interpret`, library routines in 1.8 |
| Opcode numbering 0x00–0x82 with the AMX meanings (51 decoded independently for `tools/scr.py`, about 25 more read here) | handler table 0x403150 |
| A debug string of the game calls its own save hook "amx…" | used by `script_saveCheckPoint` 0x142a40 |

Inferred from these: the library is the stock Small run-time of about 2002–2003 (file version 3,
20-byte names), compiled with computed-goto dispatch. The AMX routine each function corresponds
to is given in 1.8 and in the symbol notes.

All 120 `script.scr` files have: magic 0xf1e0, file version 3, minimum machine version 1, flags 0,
record size 24, no start address (-1), no libraries, no public variables, and exactly 8192 bytes
(2048 cells) between heap start and stack top. The file on disc is 0x60 + stack-top bytes long,
so the heap and stack live inside the loaded file image.

### 1.2 The machine structure

The first 0x60 bytes of `script.scr` are zero on disc and become the machine structure in
memory; the AMX header follows at file offset 0x60. `g_scriptMachine` (0x86b270) points at it.

| Offset | Size | AMX name | Meaning | How we know |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | ptr | base | address of the header (machine + 0x60) | `scr_load` |
| +0x04 | ptr | callback | built-in dispatcher; `scr_callNative` 0x141050 unless already set | `scr_load`; loaded before every dispatch (0x140c50) |
| +0x08 | ptr | debug | debug hook, default 0x1410b0; never called by this interpreter | `scr_load` |
| +0x0c | i32 | cip | code offset saved before each built-in call | 0x140c48, 0x140c98 |
| +0x10 | i32 | frm | frame pointer saved before each built-in call | 0x140c4c, 0x140cb0 |
| +0x14 | i32 | hea | heap top (data-relative) | read 0x13eda4, saved 0x140c40 |
| +0x18 | i32 | stk | stack pointer (data-relative); restored to its entry value on every exit | 0x13ed8c, 0x13fbc0 |
| +0x1c | i32 | stp | stack top = end of script memory | bounds tests, e.g. 0x13f0b0 |
| +0x20 | u32 | flags | 0x2000 loaded, 0x8000 code relocated (required to run, else error 22), 0x4000 cleared on every run | 0x13ed5c–0x13ed74, `scr_relocate` |
| +0x24, +0x28 | i32 | curline, curfile | written by the LINE opcode | 0x140d48, 0x140d68 |
| +0x2c | i32 | dbgcode | last debug record kind seen by the relocator | `scr_relocate` |
| +0x30..+0x38 | | dbgaddr, dbgparam, dbgname | debug records | 0x140d90–0x140db0 |
| +0x3c | 4 × i32 | usertags | tags for user data | `scr_getUserData` 0x1411c8 |
| +0x4c | 4 × ptr | userdata | user data pointers (unused by the game) | same |
| +0x5c | i32 | error | zeroed before each built-in, returned by the dispatcher; non-zero aborts the run | `scr_callNative`, 0x140c5c |

### 1.3 The file header (at machine + 0x60)

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | i32 | size of the file part (header, tables, code, data) |
| +0x04 | u16 | magic 0xf1e0 |
| +0x06, +0x07 | u8 | file version (3), required machine version (1; loader refuses 4 or more with error 18) |
| +0x08 | u16 | flags: bit 0 must be clear (error 17), bit 2 = compact encoding, expanded in place by the loader |
| +0x0a | u16 | size of a name-table record, must be 24 |
| +0x0c | i32 | code start |
| +0x10 | i32 | data start; every script address is relative to this |
| +0x14 | i32 | heap start = end of initialised data |
| +0x18 | i32 | stack top; the loader lowers it by one cell and zeroes that cell |
| +0x1c | i32 | start address of `main`, -1 in every shipped script |
| +0x20, +0x24 | i16, i32 | entry points: count, table offset. Record = {code offset, name[20]}, sorted by name |
| +0x28, +0x2c | i16, i32 | built-ins used by this script: count, table. Record = {0 on disc / handler address after load, name[20]} |
| +0x30, +0x34 | i16, i32 | libraries (none) |
| +0x38, +0x3c | i16, i32 | public variables (none) |

Entry-point names are limited to 19 characters. The 120 scripts define 1,828 entry points
(at most 165 in one level) and import at most 40 built-ins each.

### 1.4 Registers

The interpreter (`scr_interpret`, 0x13ecf8–0x140f10) is one function. Each opcode handler ends
by fetching the next code word, which the loader has already replaced by the handler's address,
and jumping to it.

| Machine register | Name in `tools/scr.py` | Held in | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRI | A | `$a1`, mirrored at host sp+4 | accumulator; result of every built-in |
| ALT | X | `$s5` | second operand, array base |
| CIP | | `$s0` | host pointer into the relocated code |
| FRM | | `$fp` | data-relative frame pointer; `local[n]` is `[FRM + n]` |
| STK | | `$s6` | data-relative stack pointer, grows down |
| HEA | | `$s3` | data-relative heap top, grows up |
| data base, code base | | `$s1`, `$t3` | header + data start, header + code start |
| entry STK | | `$t4` | written back to machine +0x18 on every exit path |
| machine | | `$s7` | |

There are no other registers and no flags: comparisons leave 0 or 1 in PRI, or are fused with
the jump.

### 1.5 Memory, variables and the stack

One block of cells holds everything, addressed from the data start:

```
0 .............. HEA ......................... STK ............ STP
 globals, strings   heap (grows up)   free    stack (grows down)
```

- **Global variables** (`var[0x..]` in the script listings) and string literals are the
  initialised data. They keep their values for as long as the level's lump stays loaded and
  are not part of a save. Nothing resets them between calls.
- **The heap** is used only by the HEAP opcode (no shipped script uses it).
- **The stack** holds arguments, return offsets, frame links and locals. Heap and stack share
  8192 bytes. The entry sequence and the STACK and HEAP opcodes fail with error 3 when fewer
  than 0x40 bytes separate the two, error 7 when STK passes the top, error 8 when HEA goes
  negative. Plain pushes are not checked.
- Indirect loads and stores check the address: it must be below HEA or at/above STK, and below
  STP, otherwise error 5 (for example 0x13f098–0x13f0bc).

A run that fails returns its error number to the host. `script_runByName` ignores it, so a
failing script simply stops and its caller sees result 0.

### 1.6 Calls

**Game to script** (`scr_interpret(machine, &result, entryIndex, argCount, args)`): the
arguments are copied below the current STK, then the argument byte count, then a zero return
offset. Execution starts at the entry point's code offset with FRM = 0. The only game-side
caller (0x1ed70c) passes no arguments, so entry points never receive any. Entry index -1 means
`main`, which no shipped script has (error 20).

**Script to script** (CALL): pushes the return offset and jumps. The callee starts with PROC
(push FRM, FRM = STK) and ends with RETN (pop FRM, pop the return offset, drop the argument
bytes counted by the cell that follows). A frame therefore looks like this:

| Address | Content |
|---|---|
| FRM + 12 + 4k | argument k |
| FRM + 8 | argument byte count |
| FRM + 4 | return offset (0 = return to the game) |
| FRM + 0 | caller's FRM |
| FRM - 4… | locals |

When the popped return offset is 0 the run ends: PRI is stored through the result pointer and
the interpreter returns 0 (0x13fc20–0x13fc3c).

**Script to built-in** (SYSREQ.C *n*, 0x140c88): the script pushes the arguments right to left,
then the byte count, executes SYSREQ.C with the index of the built-in in *its own* import table,
and afterwards drops the arguments with STACK. The interpreter saves CIP, FRM, HEA and STK into
the machine structure and calls the dispatcher at machine +4:

```
dispatcher(machine, index, &PRI, params)     // scr_callNative
    machine.error = 0
    PRI = handler[index](machine, params)    // params[0] = byte count, params[1..] = arguments
    return machine.error                     // always 0: nothing ever sets it
```

So every built-in has the signature `int handler(machine, cell *params)`, reads argument *k* at
`params + 4k`, and whatever it leaves in the return register becomes PRI. Handlers written as
"void" (for example `callScript`, `getv`, `dialogRunning`) return whatever their last callee
returned. Because the machine state is saved before the call, a built-in may start another run
on the same machine (`callScript`, or a built-in whose effect makes the game run a script,
such as `grantSilver`, which runs the entry point `firstSilver`); the nested run uses the stack
below the current STK.

There is no instruction budget, no yield and no sleep. A script that loops forever hangs the
game. `scr_raiseError` (0x141498) exists but nothing references it.

### 1.7 Strings and names

- A string argument is a data-relative address. Handlers convert it with `scr_getAddr`
  (0x1414a8, bounds check, result ignored by callers) and `scr_getString` (0x141650) into a
  stack buffer of 128 or 160 bytes. There is no length limit on the copy.
- Script string literals are *packed*: four characters per cell, first character in the most
  significant byte. `scr_getString` recognises a packed string by its first cell being above
  0xff; otherwise it reads one character per cell.
- **Entry points** are found by `scr_findEntry` (0x13eac8): binary search with a case-sensitive
  compare over the sorted table. A name of 20 or more characters can never match.
- **Built-ins** are bound at load: `scr_registerNatives` (0x141310) walks the script's import
  records and copies the handler address from the global table 0x403370 (191 × {name pointer,
  handler}, zero terminated) for each matching name.
- **Objects** are found by name with `world_findObjectsByName` (0x14bf58, case-insensitive hash
  of 512 slots, results in table order) or its first-match wrapper `world_findObjectByName`
  (0x14f498). Several objects may share a name; most built-ins act on all of them.
- **Text** arguments are keys for `text_lookup` (0x173c84). **Resources** are a lump name plus
  an entry name for `res_find` (0x17365c). **Quest variables** are looked up by lower-cased
  name in `g_questVars`. **Items** are descriptor strings for `item_parseDescriptor` (0x1069b8).

### 1.9 Opcodes

131 handlers (table 0x403150). "In scripts" marks the 51 opcodes that occur in the 120 shipped
scripts. Mnemonics are the AMX ones; `[x]` is the cell at data address x. The opcodes used by
the scripts, and in addition 0x00, 0x05–0x08, 0x1a, 0x1f, 0x20, 0x26, 0x2a, 0x2d, 0x2f, 0x32,
0x49, 0x4d, 0x75–0x78, 0x7a, 0x7c and 0x7e–0x82, were read in the handlers. The meaning of the remaining ones is Inferred from the numbering.

## 2. How the game drives the machine

The functions in this section are outside the address range (most are in `gameplay`), but the
built-ins cannot be understood without them.

### 2.1 One machine per level

`level_loadScriptAndObjects` (0x217978) loads the level lump, looks up the entry `script.scr`
and passes its address to `script_setCurrent` (0x1ed650), which stores it in `g_scriptMachine`,
calls `scr_load` and then `scr_registerNatives` with the built-in table. A level without a
script sets the pointer to 0 and every later `script_runByName` returns -1. The loader then
runs the entry point `preStart`, loads the objects, and runs `start` (both skipped when the
byte at 0x4f8b58 is set; 81 scripts define `start`, 18 define `preStart`).

`script_runByName(name)` (0x1ed694) is the whole host interface:

```
if name == null or g_scriptMachine == null: return -1
index = scr_findEntry(g_scriptMachine, name)
if not found: return -1      // also stores render-frame counter + 20 at 0x4f8694, which nothing reads
result = 0
scr_interpret(g_scriptMachine, &result, index, 0, null)     // error code ignored
return result
```

### 2.2 Who starts scripts

| Starter | Call site | Entry point comes from | Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| `level_loadScriptAndObjects` | 0x217acc, 0x217bac | fixed names `preStart`, `start` | level load |
| `script_runDeferred` | 0x1ed5f4 | deferred queue | run task, priority 125; also once from `mainloop_runSession` (0x322e6c) right after a level load |
| `script_runPostAction` | 0x1edafc | post-action buffer | called by `cut_runFrame` (0x199f6c), `help_task` (0x1dcf60, 0x1dd1f0), `game_loadLevel` (0x1e60b8), the dialog-end handler (0x22f7f0) |
| `script_callScript` | 0x143178 | script argument | nested in a running script |
| `Trigger_run` | 0x1ed160, 0x1ed188 | trigger +0x5c on entry; "not" + that name on exit | object run |
| `obj_runActionScripts` | 0x14ddec, 0x14de10 | `action` properties of a `TriggerParams` | object run |
| `MonsterTrigger_scan` | 0x1ed4a8 | `script` property, once per creature inside | object run (60-frame list) |
| `Creature_init` / `_onDeath` / `_revive` | 0x10a5ec, 0x10bf08, 0x10c0d0 | properties `initScript`, `deathScript`, `resurrectScript` | simulation |
| `Creature_updateActive` | 0x10c1b0, 0x10c1d8 | `followLostScript`, `followFoundScript` | simulation |
| `Creature_interact` (slot 14) | 0x116d2c | `dialogScript`; takes the menu mutex first | simulation (player used the NPC) |
| `Creature_trigger` (slot 3) | 0x11a648 | a property whose name the caller passes | simulation |
| `mission_grantMedal` | 0x1bdc10–0x1bdc38 | fixed names `firstBronze`, `firstSilver`, `firstGold` (only `firstSilver` exists, in 9 levels) | from the grant* built-ins |
| `JumpGate_run`, `FireBomb_run`, `Catapult_run` (slot 4) | 0x27cbc8, 0x261fb4, 0x24da4c | `script` property | object run; an armed jump gate runs its predicate on every run |
| `Catapult_takeDamage`, 0x255990 | 0x24e0e8, 0x255a88 | `deathScript` | simulation |
| `DoorSwing_interact`, `DoorSecret_interact` (slot 14) | 0x28aacc, 0x28b2b0 | `key` | simulation |
| `AutoObject_ctor`, 0x23d890 | 0x23a9b0, 0x23d8fc | `initScript`, `action<n>` | simulation |
| dialog system | 0x22f028, 0x22f4d4, 0x230eb8 | names stored in dialog data | dialog code (0x22ee84, 0x22f3d0, `dialog_showNode`); not classified further |
| **interact prompts** (slot 13) | `PushTrigger_prompt` 0x1ecb98, `AutoChest_interactPrompt` 0x23b6e8, `AutoPropLP_interactPrompt` 0x23d068, `SpiritAnchor_interactPrompt` 0x296ba0 (all `key`), `JumpGate_interactPrompt` 0x27d80c (`script`) | predicate deciding whether the object can be used | **both** `Player_run` and `Player_draw`, see P1 |
| **draw functions** (slot 5) | `NPC_draw` 0x29e5f4, `Gnome_draw` 0x26926c, `GnomeNavigator_draw` 0x26a07c, `Rondo_draw` 0x29f308 | `exclamation` property | **draw**, see P1 |
| **map drawing** | 0x1696c4 (in 0x168cac, called from `minimap_draw`) | per-marker script name | **draw**, see P1 |
| engine hooks | 0x154fd4, 0x1a90f0, 0x1c0314, 0x1c2948, 0x1c2960, 0x1dbb30 | fixed names starting with `*` (`*gotItemNotify`, `*arrowShootNotify`, `*exitInventoryNotify`, `*weaponEquipNotify`, `*bowEquipNotify`, `*inventoryOnNotify`) | item pick-up, `Player_run`, inventory, `hud_run`. No shipped script defines any of them |

Many property values are not hand-written entry points but snippets the level editor compiled
into automatically named entries: the first characters of the snippet plus a hash (`return9d74`,
`if6896`, `setvcccf`, `newWorldbcf6`). The scripts contain 108 `return…` and 161 `if…` entries
of this kind.

### 2.3 Two implicit arguments

Entry points take no arguments. Context is passed in two globals instead:

- **Selected object** `g_scriptSelectedObj` (0x4039f8): the object the script is run for. Set
  around the call by `Creature_init`, `Creature_onDeath`, `Creature_revive` (the creature),
  `Trigger_run` (the trigger, 0x1ed154, cleared at 0x1ed194), `MonsterTrigger_scan` (each
  creature in turn), `obj_runActionScripts`, 0x23d890 and 0x255990. It is 0 in deferred calls
  and post actions. The `select…` built-ins, `initScriptSetParams`, `newWorldParameter` and
  `script_setNextWorld` read it.
- **Active player** `g_scriptActivePlayer` (0x4d8ae4): a player index. Written by `Trigger_run`
  when a player enters (0x1ed15c: the lowest-numbered player inside), by `Player_interact`
  when a player uses something (0x1b2b70), by `Creature_interact` before a `dialogScript`
  (0x116d28), by `dialog_free` at level teardown (0x22fa34, sets 0), and by the built-ins
  `setBestActivePlayer` and `playGotItemSound`. It is not reset between scripts, so a deferred
  call or a death script sees the value left by whatever ran last. All of these writers are
  simulation code, so the value is the same on every machine (Inferred; see P7 for the one
  odd writer). Section 6 lists the readers.

### 2.4 Deferred calls

`addDeferedCall(name)` copies the name into the *back* half of a two-part buffer
(`g_scriptDeferNames`, 64 names of 0x50 bytes per half) and increments `g_scriptDeferQueued`;
a 65th name in one frame is dropped without notice (0x1ed52c).

`script_runDeferred` (0x1ed5a0) is a run task of priority 125 named "Script". Once per simulated
frame it runs every name in the *front* half in order, then makes the back half the front
(`g_scriptDeferCount = g_scriptDeferQueued`, queued = 0, flip the parity word 0x4f8690).

Consequences:

- A name queued before or during the Script task of frame N runs in frame N+1. A name queued
  later in frame N, by a task with a higher priority number such as the cutscene task (300)
  running a post action, runs in frame N+2.
- This is how scripts wait: an entry point does a little work, checks `gamePaused()`, counts in
  a global variable and defers itself again. The shipped scripts call `addDeferedCall` 278
  times in 61 levels.
- The queue is cleared by `script_clearDeferred` (0x1eda08) at level teardown, by
  `game_resetState` and when a save is loaded (0x222074).

### 2.5 Post action

`postAction(name)` stores one name in `g_scriptPostAction`. `script_runPostAction` (0x1edac0)
runs it once, with `g_scriptInPostAction` set, when the current cutscene ends, when a dialog
ends, from two places in `help_task`, or at the end of a level load. Scripts use it as "do this
when the cutscene I just started is over". Only one name is kept; a second `postAction`
replaces the first.

### 2.6 When scripts run within a frame

In a net game `tasks_run` (0x3226e4) is called from `net_frameLoop`, so everything below is
lockstep code unless marked.

1. Priority 10, `runObjects`: triggers, creature events, `Player_run` → `Player_interact` →
   interact prompts and interactions. Scripts started here run inline, in object order.
2. Priority 125, `script_runDeferred`: the deferred queue.
3. Priority 300, the cutscene task: the post action when a cutscene ends.
4. Game-message processing (before the tasks, in `net_frameLoop`): dialog start and end, and
   with them the post action and dialog scripts (Inferred: the two dialog functions involved,
   0x22ee84 and 0x22f6a8, are reached only through the pointer table at 0x540cc0).
5. **Draw phase** (not lockstep): NPC exclamation predicates, map-marker scripts, and the
   interact-prompt predicates through `Player_draw` (P1).

The Script task is not skipped while the game is paused: `tasks_run` calls
`tasks_call(1, -1)` (0x19e798) on every simulated tick and that function only filters draw
tasks. This is why the scripts test `gamePaused()` themselves (108 calls).

## 3. The built-ins

Conventions for the tables:

- **#** is the index in the global table 0x403370 (entry address = 0x403370 + 8 × #).
- **Arguments** are what the handler reads, in order: `s` a string, `i` an integer, `ref` the
  address of script cells, `i x8` eight integers. The count was checked against the byte
  count every shipped call pushes: they all agree, except one `getv` call with a second,
  ignored argument. For the 69 built-ins no script calls, the list comes from the handler
  alone.
- **Shared state written** is state that must match on all machines. "-" means none found.
- In the last column, **AP** = reads the active player, **NET** = behaves differently when
  `g_networkMode` is set, **LOCAL SLOT** = depends on which player this machine owns. "-" means
  nothing found by reading the handler and scanning its direct callees for the local-state
  markers listed in section 5.
- **Calls / levels**: how often the 120 shipped scripts call it. 69 built-ins are never called.
- Object offsets are in the object the name refers to; creature offsets apply to objects with
  flag 0x20.

`newWorld` and `newWorldAlways` share one handler, so there are 190 distinct handlers.

### Script control and pure helpers

| 104 | `addDeferedCall` | 0x144160 | s entry | Wraps `script_queueDeferred` (0x1ed52c): appends the name to the back buffer of the deferred queue; dropped silently when 64 names are already queued. | deferred queue 0x86b278, count 0x86da7c | - | 278 / 61 |
| 106 | `postAction` | 0x143ee4 | s entry | Wraps `script_setPostAction` (0x1eda9c): copies the name to the post-action buffer; it is run once by `script_runPostAction` (see 2.5). | post-action name 0x86fa80 | - | 105 / 45 |

### Quest variables, profile variables and campaign progress

| # | Name | Address | Arguments | What it does | Shared state written | Per-machine state read / network mode | Calls / levels |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 81 | `getv` | 0x143500 | s name | Wraps `vars_get` (0x1ed778): value (signed byte) of a quest variable. The name is lower-cased. A name that does not exist yet is appended to the table with value 0. | `g_questVars` 0x86da80 (only when the name is new) | None by itself; called from draw-time predicate scripts (P1), where the append happens on one machine only. | 790 / 64 |
| 83 | `setv` | 0x143540 | s name, i value | Wraps `vars_set` (0x1ed854): stores the value clamped to -128..127, creating the entry if needed. | `g_questVars` | - | 571 / 73 |
| 84 | `addv` | 0x143588 | s name, i delta | `vars_get` then `vars_set` of the sum; returns the unclamped sum. | `g_questVars` | - | 0 / 0 |
| 86 | `getpv` | 0x143480 | s name | Wraps `profile_getVar` (0x22289c): value of a profile variable (table 0x4f9030, same packed format as the quest variables). | profile table (appends unknown names) | The profile table belongs to the machine (it is what the config save on the memory card holds), so the result can differ between machines. No shipped script calls it. | 0 / 0 |
| 85 | `setpv` | 0x1434b4 | s name, i value | Wraps `profile_setVar` (0x22274c) with save = 1: stores the value and, if it changed, calls `memcard_requestConfigSave` (0x217bdc). | profile table 0x4f9030; memory-card state | Starts a memory-card write on each machine whose stored value differed. That makes `memcard_isBusy` differ between machines for a while, which runMedalSuccess / runMedalFail read (P2). | 27 / 9 |
| 147 | `getEvil` | 0x142044 | - | Wraps `game_getEvil` (0x1bf8d8): player 0 record +0x4c1a, bit `g_difficultyIdx`. | - | - | 63 / 19 |
| 148 | `setEvil` | 0x142058 | i on | If on != 0, wraps `game_setEvil` (0x1bf8f8) with that value; a zero argument does nothing. | every player record +0x4c1a | - | 2 / 1 |
| 149 | `getMadeDecision` | 0x142010 | - | Wraps `game_getMadeDecision` (0x1bf960). | - | - | 4 / 3 |

| 152 | `getMissionComplete` | 0x142084 | i mission | Wraps `mission_isComplete(g_difficultyIdx, mission)` (0x1bf730). | - | - | 115 / 13 |
| 153 | `setMissionAvailable` | 0x1420d0 | i mission, i on | Wraps `mission_setAvailable(g_difficultyIdx, mission, on)` (0x1bf6d0). | mission bytes in the player records | - | 88 / 23 |
| 154 | `getMissionAvailable` | 0x1420fc | i mission | Wraps `mission_isAvailable(g_difficultyIdx, mission)` (0x1bf698), which reads record 0. | - | - | 129 / 3 |
| 155 | `grantGold` | 0x14211c | i mission | Wraps `mission_grantMedal(mission, 3)` (0x1bdb80): for every player whose medal byte is lower, sets the reward-player index 0x4f7149 and runs the entry points firstBronze / firstSilver / firstGold for each level gained, then stores the level. | medal bytes (record +0x4c0d + mission), 0x4f7149, plus what the reward scripts do | - | 9 / 9 |
| 156 | `grantSilver` | 0x142140 | i mission | Same with level 2. | as grantGold | - | 9 / 9 |
| 157 | `grantBronze` | 0x142164 | i mission | Same with level 1. | as grantGold | - | 9 / 9 |
| 158 | `getMedal` | 0x142188 | i mission | Wraps `mission_getMedal(mission, -1, 0)` (0x1bf838): returns the medal byte of **this machine's first local player** (`net_getLocalPlayerSlot(0)`). | - | LOCAL SLOT: the returned value differs between machines when players hold different medals (P3). | 9 / 9 |
| 64 | `addQuest` | 0x1433c8 | s title, s text | Wraps `quest_add` (0x1d386c): appends the pair to every player's quest list unless already present (max 8). | player records +0x41d0.., count +0x43d0 | - | 43 / 20 |
| 65 | `removeQuest` | 0x143448 | s title | Wraps `quest_remove` (0x1d3968). | player quest lists | - | 30 / 19 |

### Level flow, cutscenes, dialog, saving

| # | Name | Address | Arguments | What it does | Shared state written | Per-machine state read / network mode | Calls / levels |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | `newWorld` | 0x143dd0 | s level | Unless running as a post action (0x4f8698) the call first passes `newWorld_netGate` (0x143d04). If allowed: `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` then `script_setNextWorld` (0x1472c4), which copies the level name to the next-world buffer 0x41b6d0 and takes the entrance orientation from the selected object's `orientation=` property (0xff if none). | next world 0x41b6d0 / 0x41b720; active player's cooldown record +0x4bca (net) | AP, NET: in a net game the gate refuses the change while the active player's 600-frame cooldown runs and more than one player is alive, and otherwise starts the cooldown (FINDINGS D20). The refusal text is shown only on the active player's machine. `net_closeLocalMenus` acts only in net games (sends menu-state message 2, closes local menus, ejects players from vehicles). | 163 / 71 |
| 8 | `newWorldAlways` | 0x143dd0 | s level | Table entry points at the same function as newWorld (0x143dd0), so despite the name it is gated too. An ungated variant exists at 0x143e30 but nothing references it. | as newWorld | as newWorld | 0 / 0 |
| 6 | `simpleNewWorld` | 0x143e70 | s level | Same gate; then `net_closeLocalMenus(0)`, copies the name to 0x41b6d0 and sets the orientation byte to 0xff without looking at the selected object. | as newWorld | AP, NET as newWorld | 4 / 1 |
| 9 | `newWorldPost` | 0x143cc4 | s level | Copies the name to 0x4fdcf0; the dialog-end handler (0x22f7c8) moves it to the next-world buffer when the current dialog closes. | 0x4fdcf0 | - | 5 / 3 |
| 107 | `newWorldParameter` | 0x1471fc | - | Reads the selected object's property list for `level=`; if found, `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` and `script_setNextWorld(value)`. No gate, no null check on the selected object. | next world | NET only through `net_closeLocalMenus`. | 0 / 0 |
| 121 | `setEntrance` | 0x142a94 | s name | Copies the name to 0x4f8468 (entrance used when players are placed in the next level). | 0x4f8468 | - | 76 / 30 |
| 105 | `cutScene` | 0x143f1c | s name | Builds "<level>.lmp" from the current level name 0x41b721 and "<name>.cut", finds it with `res_find` and calls `cut_start` (0x19b4dc). | cutscene state (cut_start) | `cut_start` closes local menus in a net game. | 58 / 43 |
| 15 | `startDialog` | 0x143824 | s name, i a, i b | Preloads the level lump, clears 0x4fdce8, then calls `dialog_start` (0x22fa50). That function does not start the dialog itself: if the active player is local to this machine and no dialog is open, it sends game message 0 carrying the name, the active player, a, b, and **this machine's camera position and two camera angles**. The dialog opens when the message is processed. | none directly (the message handler does the work) | AP, LOCAL SLOT, CAMERA: exactly one machine sends; the camera values in the message are that machine's (P5). | 45 / 24 |
| 18 | `dialogRunning` | 0x143cb0 | - | Wraps `dialog_isOpen` (0x22fbc0): 0x8e2d60 != 0. | - | Dialog progress is driven by a local task (pad and voice stream, 0x22ff48); whether open/closed flips on the same frame everywhere is not established here. | 0 / 0 |
| 103 | `forceMutexRelease` | 0x1471dc | - | Wraps `menuMutex_release` (0x22fc38): clears 0x4fe53c, the lock taken when an NPC conversation starts. | 0x4fe53c | - | 0 / 0 |
| 16 | `changeSwoop` | 0x1438b0 | i mode | Stores the value at 0x4fdce4 (camera swoop selection used by the dialog system). | 0x4fdce4 | - | 43 / 3 |

| 76 | `saveGame` | 0x146c04 | - | Returns at once if any player's status field (record +0x4c1c, low 5 bits) is 2. Otherwise wraps `memcard_requestSave(net_getLocalPlayerSlot(0))` (0x2175b4). | memory-card state | LOCAL SLOT, NET: opens the save flow for this machine's own player; in a net game it also sends menu-state message 2. | 3 / 3 |
| 77 | `saveEndConfig` | 0x146c78 | - | End of campaign: calls `net_notify3278f0(-1)` (0x1eb5c8), clears 0x4d8a08 and 0x4039c0, sets 0x41b4f8, 0x4f85c5 and `g_paused`, in a net game calls `net_dropAllRemotes` (0x13def8), sets the completion bit for the difficulty in 0x4f8f38 and calls `memcard_requestConfigSave`. | `g_paused`, peer dropped flags, 0x4f8f38, memory-card state | NET: every machine marks all *other* peers as dropped, which ends lockstep. Everything after this call runs as a private game. | 3 / 3 |
| 78 | `saveDone` | 0x146d5c | - | Returns 1 when `memcard_getState()` (0x217550) is -1, i.e. no card operation is running. | - | MEMORY CARD: purely local hardware state returned to the script (P4). | 6 / 3 |
| 132 | `saveCheckPoint` | 0x142a40 | - | Debug print, then `save_game(0, 0, 1)` (0x218128). | save buffer | Runs in lockstep on every machine (names.tsv). | 16 / 15 |

### Menus, HUD and medal results

| # | Name | Address | Arguments | What it does | Shared state written | Per-machine state read / network mode | Calls / levels |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | `activateMissionMenu` | 0x143fa8 | - | Does nothing if a dialog is open or the recall flag 0x41b51d is set. Otherwise `missionMenu_open` (0x231520) for the active player (offline) or for `net_firstActiveSlot()` (net). That function registers a run task and a draw task. | mission-menu state, task list | AP offline only. NET: slot chosen by peer state, not by the active player. Depends on `dialog_isOpen` (see dialogRunning). | 4 / 2 |
| 11 | `activateStore` | 0x144010 | i store | Stores the store index (if < 21) at 0x4f7150. If a dialog is open it only sets the pending flag 0x4fdd30 (the dialog-end handler opens the store later). Otherwise: offline, `shop_openOrStock(activePlayer, 0, 1)`; net, for every living player **that is local to this machine**: `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` then `shop_openOrStock(slot, 0, 1)`. | 0x4f7150, 0x4fdd30; shop UI state; in a net game vehicle occupancy through `net_closeLocalMenus` | AP offline. NET + LOCAL SLOT: the shop opens only on machines with a living local player; `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` (which ejects every living player from a vehicle) is called only on those machines (P6). | 45 / 4 |
| 12 | `storeRunning` | 0x1440f8 | - | Returns `g_shopOpen` (0x41b50c). | - | MENU: per-machine UI state. No shipped script calls it. | 0 / 0 |

| 128 | `showBust` | 0x142864 | s texture, s textKey, i a, i b | `hud_setBust(texture, text, a, b)` (0x1dfaa0). | HUD (cosmetic) | Same local gate as showCompass. | 31 / 17 |
| 122 | `hudResetFadeScreen` | 0x14277c | i on | `hud_setFade` (0x1df5d0): fade level 0 or 0x80. | `g_hudFade` 0x4f66ac | - | 0 / 0 |
| 123 | `hudFadeScreen` | 0x14279c | i delta | `hud_stepFade` (0x1df5ec): adds to the fade level, draws the overlay, returns the new level. | `g_hudFade` | Draws from a run task. | 0 / 0 |

| 170 | `runMedalSuccess` | 0x1417a4 | i mission, i oldMedal, s titleKey, s key1, s key2, s key3 | Medal-mission result screen, meant to be called every frame. Sets 0x4f7114 = 2. Draws the result box and the reward lines directly. Then tests the medal player's pad word (+0xc of `g_pads[0x4f7148]`): confirm restarts the level (next world = current level), cancel calls `game_openMissionMenu` (0x1eb4f0). Returns 1 when either was pressed, else 0. Offline it also sets `g_paused`. | 0x4f7114, `g_paused` (offline), next world, mission menu | NET, LOCAL SLOT, MEMORY CARD: see P2. On the medal player's machine it returns 0 while the memory card is busy and until the "ready" message 12 has come back; on other machines it waits for that message. Reward lines are chosen from the local player's medal byte. | 30 / 9 |
| 171 | `runMedalFail` | 0x141c00 | s textKey | Same flow as runMedalSuccess with the failure box. | as runMedalSuccess | as runMedalSuccess | 10 / 9 |

## 4. Helper functions in the range that are not built-ins

| Address | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 0x143d04 | `newWorld_netGate` | Net games only, and only when the active player is not -1. If that player's cooldown (record +0x4bca) is running and more than one player is alive: shows a HUD line on the active player's machine and returns 1 (refuse). Otherwise sets the cooldown to 600 and returns 0. Offline it always returns 0. |
| 0x143e30 | `script_newWorldNoGate` | A copy of the newWorld handler without the gate. Not in the table, not referenced. |
| 0x144198 | `script_checkMonstersLeft_cb` | Per-object callback of `checkMonstersLeft`. |
| 0x144494 | `script_applyMonsterVal` | Body of `setMonsterVal` / `selectSetMonsterVal`. |
| 0x1445fc | `script_applyCFlag` | Body of `setCFlag` / `selectSetCFlag`. |
| 0x1447c4 | `script_applyOFlag` | Body of `setOFlag` / `selectSetOFlag`. |
| 0x1472c4 | `script_setNextWorld` | Writes the next-world name (0x41b6d0) and entrance byte (0x41b720). The level change itself happens elsewhere when the buffer is non-empty. |

Related data: 0x41b721 is the current level name (used by `cutScene`, `startDialog`,
`runMedalSuccess`); 0x4f7148 is the "medal player" byte used by the medal-mission built-ins
(written by the mission menu at 0x232040 and cleared by `game_loadLevel` at 0x1e6208 when
medal mode 0x4f713c is off); 0x4f7149 is the reward player set by `mission_grantMedal`;
0x4f7140 is set by the handler of game message 12 (0x1d9224) and cleared by `game_loadLevel`.

## 5. Per-machine state

How this was checked: every handler was read; then each handler and its direct callees (and
their callees) were scanned for references to `g_networkMode`, the cosmetic seed, camera
position and focus, `g_localMenuOpen`, raw pads, the ghost pointer, render counters, the
memory-card state, shop / help / dialog state, the active player, and for calls to
`net_getLocalPlayerSlot`, `net_isLocalSlot`, `net_firstActiveSlot`, the audio-status and
near-camera functions. Virtual calls were not followed. Kinds: **Observed** = the read is in
the bytes at the address; **Inferred** = the consequence follows but was not seen.

No built-in tests the prediction-copy flag 0x20000, and none needs to as long as scripts are
never started while `net_predictLocalPlayer` runs. The only script start reachable from
`Player_run` without such a test is the `*arrowShootNotify` hook (P9).

### P1. Level scripts are executed from draw code (Observed; consequence partly Inferred)

- `NPC_draw` 0x29e3ec runs the object's `exclamation` script each time the NPC is drawn and
  passes two tests against the local camera position 0x44f038 (a plane test and a distance
  above 240 units, 300 during a cutscene); call at 0x29e5f4. The result decides whether the
  marker over the NPC's head is drawn. `Gnome_draw` (call at 0x26926c), `GnomeNavigator_draw`
  (0x26a07c) and `Rondo_draw` (0x29f308) read the same property and call the same function;
  their conditions were not read.
- The map-drawing function 0x168cac, called from `minimap_draw`, tests a quest variable
  (`vars_get` at 0x1696a4) and runs a script (0x1696c4) for map entries that name one.
- `Player_draw` 0x1a46c0 calls `Player_interact(player, 0, displayOnly = 1)` for players local
  to the machine (0x1a4800). `Player_interact` calls virtual slot 13 of the nearest usable
  object in both modes, and for five classes that function runs `key` / `script` predicates
  (list in 2.2). `Player_run` makes the same call once per simulated frame for every real
  player (0x1a5c1c, under the same pause / dialog conditions), so these predicates run on all
  machines in lockstep *and* additionally on the owner's machine at display rate.

What this means for this area: the interpreter has no read-only mode, so a built-in reached
from one of these scripts executes a different number of times on different machines (drawing
depends on the local camera, the frame rate and which players are local).

What the shipped scripts do (Observed over all 120 scripts for the 108 automatically named
`return…` snippets, which is what a predicate looks like): they call only `getv`,
`playerHasItem`, `getEvil`, `checkPlayerGold`, `countQuestItems`, `getMissionComplete` and
`callScript`; the ten callees reached through `callScript` add `getMissionAvailable`,
`demoRunning` and `getNumPlayers`. Side effects that remain:

- `getv` appends an unknown name to `g_questVars` (value 0). The table then differs in order
  between machines. Lookups are by name, so values are unaffected (Inferred harmless; the save
  file lists the variables in table order).
- Two callees use script globals as scratch (`checkScrolls` in HONOR, `checkexit` in NITBONUS).
  They recompute before use.
- `JumpGate_interactPrompt` itself, not the script, marks the gate as found from this path:
  it writes gate +0x4d and calls `jumpgate_addCurrentLevel` (0x27d830, 0x27db60; Observed).
  Inferred: on the machine that owns the approaching player this can happen at draw time,
  up to one frame before the other machines do it in `Player_run`; `JumpGate_run` reads
  +0x4d and then draws from the gate's private generator. Followed no further (belongs to
  `monsters`).

Unknown: six of the 161 `if…` snippets do have side effects (`setv`, `startDialog`, `newWorld`,
`cutScene`, `saveCheckPoint`; in BLOOD1, DIS2, E3BLOOD, NITBONUS, TORMENTA). They are probably
actions, not predicates, but that depends on which object property names them, and
`objects.ob` was available for only four levels. A `getRand` in a predicate would desynchronise
`g_randSeed` at once; none of the `return…` snippets has one.

### P2. `runMedalSuccess` / `runMedalFail`: result depends on the local slot and the local memory card (Observed; reachability Unknown)

In a net game (0x1417e8 / 0x141c10) the handler compares `net_getLocalPlayerSlot(0)` with the
medal player 0x4f7148 (0x14180c–0x141814 / 0x141c50–0x141c58):

```
on the medal player's machine:           on every other machine:
    if memcard_isBusy(): return 0            if not readyFlag: return 0
    if not readyFlag:                        if memcard_isBusy(): skip the drawing
        send game message 12; return 0
    draw the box                             draw the box (unless skipped)
both: test the medal player's pad word; on confirm or cancel write the next world
      (and open the mission menu on cancel) and return 1, else return 0
```

`readyFlag` is 0x4f7140, set when message 12 is processed. So the medal player's machine
waits for its own card write (started by `setpv`, P4) before it lets everyone continue; that
part is a deliberate handshake. The hazard is the first line: after the flag is set, the
medal player's machine still returns 0 without testing the pad whenever its card is busy
(0x14181c, 0x141824), while the others test the pad (0x141858–0x141868 jump to the pad test).
If a press arrives in such a frame, the other machines write the next world and return 1 to
the script, which then calls `restorePlayer`, and the owner's machine does neither. Whether
the card can be busy at that point is not established.

The box and reward lines are drawn directly from this run-task code, and which reward lines
appear depends on the local player's own medal (`mission_getMedal` with flag 0, 0x1418ac);
that part is cosmetic.

Related (Observed, outside the range): both handlers set the countdown 0x4f7114 to 2 on every
call. While it is positive, the run task at 0x1e3d60 calls `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` on the
medal player's machine only, and only if a menu is open there. That function also empties
vehicles, so this is the same pattern as P6.

### P3. `getMedal` returns the local player's medal (Observed)

`mission_getMedal(mission, -1, 0)` reads the record of `net_getLocalPlayerSlot(0)`
(0x1bf868). The value handed to the script differs between machines whenever the players'
medal histories differ. In all nine shipped uses the value is stored in a script global and
passed only as the second argument of `runMedalSuccess`, where it selects text. So today it
puts a per-machine value into script memory without reaching shared state (Observed for the
nine medal scripts).

### P4. Memory-card state reaches scripts (Observed)

- `saveDone` returns whether this machine's card state is idle (0x146d64).
- `saveGame` starts the save flow for this machine's first local player (0x146c58).
- `setpv` starts a config save on every machine whose stored profile value differed
  (`profile_setVar` → `memcard_requestConfigSave`), and `getpv` returns the profile value of
  this machine.
- `endGame` starts the end-of-game save for the local slot.

The three scripts that call `saveDone` (ACTINTRO, ENDGOOD, ENDBAD) call `saveEndConfig` first,
which drops every remote peer (`net_dropAllRemotes`, called at 0x146cc4), so by then there is no
lockstep left (Inferred from the script order). `getpv` is never called. The link that
matters is `setpv` → card busy → P2.

### P5. `startDialog`: one machine speaks for all, with its own camera (Observed)

`dialog_start` (0x22fa50) acts only where `net_isLocalSlot(g_scriptActivePlayer)` is true
(0x22fa94) and no dialog is open (0x22faa4). It puts that machine's camera position
(0x44f038, read at 0x22fb1c) and two camera angles into game message 0 and sends it
(0x22fb94). Every machine opens the dialog from the message, so the camera values are shared
once sent (Inferred). Two things are decided per machine before that: whether exactly one
machine sends (this needs the active player to be the same everywhere, see 2.3) and the
dialog-open test on the sender. No writer of the active player stores -1; the tests for -1
in `newWorld_netGate` and `putPlayersInVehicle` look defensive.

### P6. `activateStore` in a net game does shared work only on some machines (Observed; effect Inferred)

In the net branch (0x14405c) the handler loops over living players and, for each one that is
local to this machine (0x1440a4), calls `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` (0x1440b4) and
`shop_openOrStock(slot, 0, 1)` (0x1440c4). `net_closeLocalMenus(0)` is not purely local: it
also ejects every living player from a vehicle. A machine whose own player is dead skips the
call. If a player is in a vehicle when a store opens, vehicle state diverges (Inferred; the
four levels that call `activateStore` were not checked for vehicles). The store UI itself is
per machine by design. Offline the store opens for the active player.

`storeRunning`, `helpMessageActive`, `dialogRunning` and `playerSelRunning` return menu state
(`g_shopOpen`, `g_helpMessageOpen`, the dialog pointer, 0x4fbbdc). The first two are certainly
per machine in a net game. No shipped script calls any of the four. Internally
`activateMissionMenu` and `activateStore` branch on the dialog-open test (0x143fb0, 0x14403c)
and `activateMissionMenu` then registers tasks, so they inherit whatever synchronisation the
dialog system has.

### P7. `playGotItemSound` rewrites the active player (Observed)

The handler clamps `g_scriptActivePlayer` to 0..1 and stores it back (0x146508, 0x146518)
before calling `player_voice`, which itself returns immediately unless the slot is local and
reads audio status. The write is the same on all machines, so it is not a desync, but in a
game with three or four players it silently turns active player 2 or 3 into 1 for every later
reader (the newWorld gate's cooldown, `startDialog`'s choice of sender). Three levels call it
(DRUNARM, STORM4, TORMENT2).

### P8. `playerAdjustStat` with an explicit player sends a message from every machine (Observed; effect Inferred)

For a player other than -1 the handler calls `invmsg_sendStatPoint` (0x1c5780) instead of
changing the record. A script runs on every machine, so every machine sends inventory message
6 and the stat would be raised once per machine. All 27 shipped calls pass -1 (direct change
of the reward player), so this is latent.

### P9. Script hooks reachable during prediction (Observed; inert in shipped data)

`Player_run` calls `script_runByName` for `*arrowShootNotify` at 0x1a90f0. The code just before
it tests the prediction-copy flag only to skip an ammunition decrement (0x1a9050–0x1a9088), not
the hook. No level defines the entry point, so today the call returns -1. The inventory hooks
(`*inventoryOnNotify` from `hud_run`, `*exitInventoryNotify`, the equip hooks) are driven by
local menu code in the same way.

### P10. HUD-only differences (Observed, cosmetic)

`setInfo`, `showCompass`, `showBust`, `addHelpMessage` and `addHelpMessageF` write HUD state
only on machines where the target slot is local or where no local menu is open
(`hud_showMessage` 0x1d92a0, `hud_setCompassTarget` 0x1df668, `hud_setBust` 0x1dfaa0,
`hud_showHelpMessage` 0x1d9830). `addHelpMessage` in a net game additionally sends menu-state
message 2 for the first living local player. `shakeCamera`, `hidePlayers`, `setFarClip`,
`setWaveDetail`, `changeSwoop`, `hudFadeScreen` and the audio built-ins write presentation
state identically everywhere. `addExpandingPool` goes through `decal_add`, which reads the
camera position (0x19faa8) and a local detail option; no shipped script calls it.

### Not hazards, checked

- Object lists come from the name hash in insertion order, not from pointer order
  (`world_findObjectsByName`).
- `g_scriptSelectedObj` is a pointer but is only dereferenced, never compared or returned.
- `getRand`, `givePlayerRandom`, `generateMonster`, `dropItem`, `lightEffect`,
  `particleMorph`, `hornOmen`, `planarSteel` and the give-item built-ins advance `g_randSeed`
  (directly or through an object constructor). That is correct for lockstep and wrong only
  in a script that runs from draw code (P1).
- None of the audio or particle wrappers references `g_randSeed` or the cosmetic seed directly.
- `reapEnemies`, `checkMonstersLeft` and `objInPlayerTrig` walk the world with
  `g_excludeMask`, so they do not see the prediction copy while simulating.
- `gamePaused`, `getLevelTimer`, `getManaUsed`, `getHealthUsed`, `countPlayersAlive`,
  `checkPlayerAlive` read lockstep state (the level timer advances in the run task at
  0x1e3d60 when the game is not frozen; the potion counters are written in
  `Player_usePotion`, which is guarded against the prediction copy, FINDINGS G8).

## 6. Reference lists

### Built-ins that read the active player (0x4d8ae4)

| Built-in | Where | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `newWorld`, `newWorldAlways`, `simpleNewWorld` | `newWorld_netGate` 0x143d24, 0x143d5c, 0x143da4 | net only: whose cooldown is tested and set; whose machine shows the refusal |
| `startDialog` | `dialog_start` 0x22fa8c, 0x22fb14 | which machine sends the dialog message; the value is put in the message |
| `activateMissionMenu` | 0x143ffc | offline only: who gets the menu |
| `activateStore` | 0x144070 (and the deferred open in the dialog-end handler, 0x22f868) | offline only: who gets the store |
| `playGotItemSound` | 0x1464f0, 0x14654c | whose voice plays; also rewrites it (P7) |
| `activePlayerIsDwarf` | 0x1465a8 | reads that player's record +0x54 |
| `putPlayersInVehicle` | 0x142e3c, 0x142e70 | boards that player first |
| `setBestActivePlayer` | 0x1470fc–0x14712c | writes it and returns it |

### Built-ins that behave differently when `g_networkMode` is set

| Built-in | Where | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| `networkMode` | 0x14221c | returns the flag |
| `runMedalSuccess`, `runMedalFail` | 0x1417e8, 0x141a78; 0x141c10, 0x141ce8 | offline: sets `g_paused`; net: P2, and the button prompt is drawn only for the medal player |
| `newWorld`, `newWorldAlways`, `simpleNewWorld` | 0x143d0c | the cooldown gate exists only in net games |
| `newWorld…`, `newWorldParameter`, `cutScene`, `activateStore`, `activateMissionMenu` | `net_closeLocalMenus` 0x1eb000 | that function does nothing offline; in a net game it sends menu-state message 2, closes local menus and (argument 0) empties vehicles |
| `activateMissionMenu` | 0x143fd4 | offline: active player; net: first active slot |
| `activateStore` | 0x14405c | offline: active player; net: every living local player (P6) |
| `saveEndConfig` | 0x146c98 | net: drops all remote peers |
| `saveGame` | `memcard_requestSave` 0x21766c | net: only for a local slot, and announces the menu |
| `getMedal` | `mission_getMedal` 0x1bf85c | the flag-0 path used here reads the local slot in both modes; offline that is slot 0 |
| `addHelpMessage`, `addHelpMessageF` | `hud_showHelpMessage` 0x1d9874 | net: needs a living local player, sends message 2 |
| `givePlayerItem`, `giveOnePlayerItem`, `givePlayerRandom` | `inventory_giveItem` 0x1c18c8, 0x1c1a10, 0x1c1bd0 | the first-recall-potion tutorial (sets a quest variable, shows a hint) is offline only |
| `playGotItemSound` | `player_voice` 0x1b7be8 | offline the voice is also suppressed while a local menu is open |
| `pauseGameControl` | `tasks_run` 0x322710 | net: the lock-out it sets is zeroed at the start of every `tasks_run` (Inferred) |
| `playerAdjustStat` (explicit player) | `invmsg_sendStatPoint` | sends a message (P8) |

Built-ins that call `net_isLocalSlot` only to decide about sound or HUD text
(`givePlayerExp`, `removePlayerItem`, the equip path of `givePlayerItem`) behave the same in
both modes because that function returns true for every slot offline.

## 7. Notes on existing entries (not edited here)

- FINDINGS D20 calls the writer of the active player at 0x22fa34 "a mission-menu reset". It is
  `dialog_free` (0x22f99c), which resets the dialog system and is called from
  `game_clearLevel` (0x1e50c8), i.e. at level teardown on every machine.
- The note on `scr_load` (0x13e8f8) in `symbols/netcode.tsv` says "version 0x18" and "unpacks
  the relocation list". The 0x18 is the name-record size at header +0xa, and the loop expands
  the optional compact encoding (header flag bit 2), which no shipped script uses.
  `scr_findInTable38` (0x13ebd8) is the public-variable lookup; the table is empty in every
  script.
- `tools/scr.py` prints a string literal whose pool offset is below 8 as a number (hence
  listings such as `callScript(0)`), and it does not show arguments that were pushed with
  PUSH.pri / PUSH.alt. The true argument count is the PUSH.C just before each SYSREQ.C
  divided by 4; the counts in section 3 were taken from there.
- The Ghidra export names 0x143dd0 `script_newWorldAlways`; names.tsv has `script_newWorld`.
  Both table entries point at it.

## 8. Open questions

1. **Does a level's script image survive between visits?** `scr_load` skips its whole
   initialisation when machine flag 0x2000 is already set. If a lump stays cached and the
   level is entered again without re-reading the file, the script's global variables keep
   their old values. Settle by reading how `lump_load` and the level teardown free lumps.
2. **P2 reachability**: can `memcard_isBusy()` be true on the medal player's machine after
   message 12 has been processed? Needs the card state machine (`audio-save`) and a test with
   two machines finishing a medal mission.
3. **Medal player 0x4f7148**: it is written by the mission menu from 0x4f6960. Is that value
   the same on every machine in a net game? `removeAllItems`, `removeAllWeapons`,
   `clearAllSkills`, `savePlayer`, `restorePlayer` and `givePlayerItem` in medal mode all act
   on it.
4. **Draw-time predicates (P1)**: extract `objects.ob` for all levels and list every `key`,
   `exclamation`, jump-gate `script` and map-marker property; check that none names an entry
   with side effects (start with the six `if…` snippets named in P1).
5. **Dialog open flag**: is 0x8e2d60 set and cleared on the same simulated frame everywhere?
   `activateStore`, `activateMissionMenu`, `Player_run` and `dialog_start` branch on it.
6. **Inventory message 6** from several machines (P8): does the handler apply it once per
   sender?
7. Does `player_voice` (0x1b7ba8) or `shop_openOrStock` in mode 0 write anything that must be
   shared? Both run only on the owner's machine when reached from `playGotItemSound` /
   `activateStore`.
8. Meaning of the creature fields the monster built-ins set: +0x3ac / +0x3ae / +0x3b0 /
   +0x3c4, flag-word bits 0, 23, 26, 27, 43, 44, virtual slots 27 and 34, AI state 0x14, and
   the 14 values of `setParticle`.
9. The byte at 0x4f8b58 that suppresses `preStart` and `start` (probably "loading a save").

## 9. Not done

- About 55 opcode handlers that no shipped script uses were not read individually.
- Callees of the built-ins were read one level deep (two for the local-state scan); virtual
  calls were not followed, so "none found" in the tables means "none in the handler or its
  direct callees".
- The vehicle built-ins and `setParticle` were only skimmed; no shipped script uses the
  former.
- Nothing here was run. The hazards P1, P2 and P6 in particular need two running copies.
